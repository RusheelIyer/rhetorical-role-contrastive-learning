            "text": "It was just the other day that our brothers Ranganath Misra and M.M. Dutt, JJ. had to give directions in a case (Vincent Panikurbangara v. Union of India) where a public spirited litigant had complained about the unscrupulous exploitation of the Indian Drug and Pharmaceutical Market by multinational Corporations by putting in circulation low-quality and even deleterious drugs\tRatio of the decision\nIn this group of cases we are faced with a different problem of alleged exploitation by big manufacturers of bulk drugs\tRatio of the decision\nThe problem is that of high prices, bearing, it is said, little relation to the cost of production to the manufacturers\tRatio of the decision\nBy way of illustration, we may straightaway mention a glaring instance of such high-pricing which was brought to our notice at the very commencement of the hearing\tRatio of the decision\nBarlagan Ketone', a bulk drug, was not treated as an essential bulk drug under the Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder, 1970 and was not included in the schedule to that order\tRatio of the decision\nA manufacturer was, under the provisions of that Order, free to continue to sell the drug at the price reported by him to the Central Government at the time of the commencement of the order, but was under an obligation not to increase the price without the prior approval of the Central Government\tRatio of the decision\nThe price which the manufacturer of Barlagan Kotone, reported to the Central Government in 1971 was Rs.24,735.68 per Kg\tFacts\nAfter the 1979 Drugs (prices Control\tFacts\nOrder came into force, the distinction between essential and non-essential bulk drugs was abolished and a maximum price had to be fixed for Barlagan Ketone also like other bulk drugs\tFacts\nThe manufacturer applied for fixation of price at Rs.8,500 per Kg\tFacts\nThe Government, however, fixed the price at Rs.1,810 per Kg\tRatio of the decision\nFor the moment, ignoring the price fixed by the Government, we see that the price of Rs.24,735 per Kg\tRatio of the decision\nat which the manufacturer was previously selling the drug and at which he continues to market the drug to this day because of the quashing of the order fixing the price by the High Court, is so unconsciously high even compared with the price claimed by himself that it appears to justify the charge that some manufacturers do indulge in 'profiteering\tRatio of the decision\nProfiteering, by itself, is evil\tRatio of the decision\nProfiteering in the scarce resources of the community, much needed life-sustaining food-stuffs and lifesaving drugs is diabolic\tRatio of the decision\nIt is a menance which had to be lettered and curbed\tRatio of the decision\nOne of the principal objectives of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 is precisely that\tRatio of the decision\nt must be remembered that Art\tStatute\n39(b) enjoins a duty on the State towards securing 'that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good\tStatute\nThe Essential Commodities Act is a legislation towards that end\tStatute\nS. 3(1) of the Essential Commodities Act enables the Central Government, if it is of opinion 'that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair price', to 'provide for regulating or prohibiting by order, the production, supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein\tStatute\nIn particular, s. 3(2)(c) enables the Central Government, to make an order providing for controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold\tStatute\nIt is in pursuance of the powers granted to the Central Government by the Essential Commodities Act that first the Drugs (prices Control\tStatute\nOrder, 1970 and later the Drugs (prices Control\tStatute\nOrder, 1979 were made\tStatute\nArmed with authority under the Drugs (prices Control\tFacts\nOrder, 1979 the Central Government issued notifications fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs may be sold by the manufacturers\tFacts\nThese notifications were questioned on several grounds by the manufacturers and they have been quashed by the Delhi High Court on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice\tFacts\nSince prices of 'formulations' are primarily dependent on prices of 'buli drugs', the notifications fixing the retail prices of formulations were also quashed\tFacts\nThe manufacturers had also filed review petitions before the Government under paragraph 27 of the 1979 Order\tFacts\nThe review petitions could not survive after the notifications sought to be reviewed had themselves been quashed\tFacts\nNevertheless the High Court gave detailed directions regarding the manner of disposal of the review petitions by the High Court\tFacts\nThe Union of India has preferred these appeals by Special leave of this Court against the judgment of the High Court\tFacts\nThe case for the Union of India was presented to us ably by Shri G. Ramaswami, the learned Additional Solicitor General and the manufacturers were represented equally ably by Shri Anil Diwan\tFacts\nBefore we turn to the terms of the Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder, 1979 we would like to make certain general observations and explain the legal position in regard to them\tRatio of the decision\nWe start with the observation, 'Price-fixation is neither the function nor the forte of the Court\tRatio of the decision\nWe concern ourselves neither with the policy nor with the rates\tRatio of the decision\nBut we do not totally deny ourselves the jurisdiction to enquire into the question, in appropriate proceedings, whether relevant considerations have gone in and irrelevant considerations kept out of the determination of the price\tRatio of the decision\nFor example, if the Legislature has decreed the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determination of the price, we will, if necessary, enquire into the question whether the policy and the factors are present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price\tRatio of the decision\nBut our examination will stop there\tRatio of the decision\nWe will go no further\tRatio of the decision\nWe will not deluge ourselves with more facts and figures\tRatio of the decision\nThe assembling of the raw materials and the mechanics of price fixation are the concern of the executive and we leave it to them\tRatio of the decision\nAnd, we will not revaluate the considerations even if the prices are demonstrably injurious to some manufacturers or producers\tRatio of the decision\nThe Court will, of course, examine if there is any hostile discrimination\tRatio of the decision\nThat is a different 'cup of tea' altogether\tRatio of the decision\nThe second observation we wish to make is, legislative action, plenary or subordinate, is not subject to rules of natural justice\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of Parliamentary legislation, the proposition is self-evident\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of subordinate 'legislation, it may happen that Parliament may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing-there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say, for example, levying a municipal rate--,in which case the substantial non-observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation\tRatio of the decision\nThe right here given to rate payers or others is in the nature of a concession which is not to detract from the character of the activity as legislative and not quasijudicial\tRatio of the decision\nBut, where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing, no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity\tRatio of the decision\nOccasionally, the legislature directs the subordinate legislating body to make 'such enquiry as it thinks fit' before making the subordinate legislation\tRatio of the decision\nIn such a situation, while such enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it deems fit is a condition precedent to the subordinate legislation, the nature and the extent of the enquiry is in the discretion of the subordinate legislating body and the subordinate legislation is not open to question on the ground that the enquiry was not as full as it might have been\tRatio of the decision\nThe provision for 'such enquiry as it thinks fit' is generally an enabling provision, intended to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain relevant information from all and whatever source and not intended to vest any right in any one other than the subordinate-legislating body\tRatio of the decision\nIt is the sort of enquiry which the legislature itself may cause to be made before legislating, an enquiry which will not confer any right on anyone\tRatio of the decision\nThe third observation we wish to make is, price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative activity than any other\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that, with the proliferation of delegated legislation, there is a tendency for the line between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion\tRatio of the decision\nAdministrative, quasi-judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and, conversely, legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi-judicial activity\tRatio of the decision\nAny attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions, it has been said, is 'difficult in theory and impossible in practice\tRatio of the decision\nThough difficult, it is necessary that the line must sometimes be drawn as different legal fights and consequences may ensue\tRatio of the decision\nThe distinction between the two has usually been expressed as 'one between the general and the particular\tRatio of the decision\nA legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases; an administrative act is the making and issue of a specific direction or the application of a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the requirements of policy\tRatio of the decision\nLegislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future; administration is the process of performing particular acts, of issuing particular orders or of making decisions which apply general rules to particular cases\tRatio of the decision\nIt has also been said \"Rule making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class\" while, \"an adjudication, on the other hand, applies to specific individuals or situations\tRatio of the decision\nBut, this is only a bread distinction, not necessarily always true\tRatio of the decision\nAdministration and administrative adjudication may also be of general application and there may be legislation of particular application only\tRatio of the decision\nThat is not ruled out\tRatio of the decision\nAgain, adjudication determines past and present facts and declares rights and liabilities while legislation indicates the future course of action\tRatio of the decision\nAdjudication is determinative of the past and the present while legislation is indicative of the future\tRatio of the decision\nThe object of the rule, the reach of its application, the rights and obligations arising out of it, its intended effect on past, present and future events, its form, the manner of its promulgation are some factors which may help in drawing the line between legislative and non-legislative acts\tRatio of the decision\nA price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer\tRatio of the decision\nIt is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or transactions\tRatio of the decision\nIt is a direction of a general character, not directed against a particular situation\tRatio of the decision\nIt is intended to operate in the future\tRatio of the decision\nIt is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public\tRatio of the decision\nThe right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the State to so provide them are transformed into the power of the State to fix prices and the obligation of the producer to charge n6 more than the price fixed\tRatio of the decision\nViewed from whatever angle, the angle of general application the prospectivity of its effect, the public interest served, and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom, there can be no question that price fixation is ordinarily a legislative activity\tRatio of the decision\nPricefixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi-judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals\tRatio of the decision\nSuch situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the Government or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined according to the statutory guidelines laid down by it\tRatio of the decision\nIn such situations the determination of price may acquire aquasi-judicial character\tRatio of the decision\nOtherwise, price fixation is generally a legislative activity\tRatio of the decision\nWe also wish to clear a misapprehension which appears to prevail in certain circles that price-fixation affects the manufacturer or producer primarily and therefore fairness requires that he be given an opportunity and that fair opportunity to the manufacturer or producer must be read into the procedure for price-fixation\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not agree with the basic premise that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers\tRatio of the decision\nThose who are most vitally affected are the consumer public\tRatio of the decision\nIt is for their protection that price-fixation is resorted to and any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer, if not more\tRatio of the decision\nThe three observations made by us are well-settled and wellfounded on authority\tRatio of the decision\nThe cases to which we shall now refer, will perhaps elucidate what we have tried, unfelicitously, to express\tRatio of the decision\nIn Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, [1974\tPrecedent\n1 SCC 468 1973 Indlaw SC 291 a notification fixing the ex-factory price of certain counts of cotton yarn was questioned on the ground that the price had been arbitrarily fixed\tPrecedent\nAfter referring to Hari Shanker Bagla v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1955] 1 SCR 380 1954 Indlaw SC 135; Union of India v. Bhanamal Gulzarimal, [1960] 2 SCR 627 1959 Indlaw SC 127; Sri Krishna Rice Mills v.

Union of India\tPrecedent\n1973] 3 SCC 435 1972 Indlaw SC 334 and Premier Automobiles Ltd. v. Union of India, [1972\tPrecedent\n2 SCR 526 1971 Indlaw SC 291 a constitution bench of the court observed that the dominant object and the purpose of the legislation was the equitable distribution and availability of commodities at fair price and if profit and the producer's return were to be kept in the forefront, it would result in losing sight of the object and the purpose of the-legislation\tPrecedent\nIf the prices of yarn or cloth were fixed in such a way to enable the manufacturer or producer recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit, no aspect of infringement of any fundamental right could be said to arise\tPrecedent\nIt was to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those were engaged in the industry, trade or commerce alleged'that they were incurring loss would not render the law stipulating the price unreasonable\tPrecedent\nIt was observed, \"The control of prices may have effect either on maintaining or ,increasing supply of commodity or securing equitable distribution and availability at fair prices\tPrecedent\nThe controlled price has to retain this equilibrium in the supply and demand of the commodity\tPrecedent\nThe cost of production, a reasonable return to the producer of the commodity are to be taken into account\tPrecedent\nThe producer must have an incentive to produce\tPrecedent\nThe fair price must be fair not only from the point of view of the consumer but also from the point of view of the producer\tPrecedent\nIn fixing the prices, a price line has to be held in order to give preference or pre-dominant consideration to the interest of the consumer or the general public over that of the producers in respect of essential commodities\tPrecedent\nThe aspect of ensuring availability of the essential commodities to the consumer equitably and at fair price is the most important consideration\tPrecedent\nThe producer should not be driven out of his producing business\tPrecedent\nHe may have to bear loss in the same way as he does when he suffers losses on account of economic forces operating in the business\tPrecedent\nIf an essential commodity is in short supply or there is hoarding, concerning or there is unusual demand, there is abnormal increase in price\tPrecedent\nIf price increases, it becomes injurious to the consumer\tPrecedent\nThere is no justification that the producer should be given the benefit of price increase attributable to hoarding or cornering or artificial short supply\tPrecedent\nIn such a case, if an \"escalation\" in price is contemplated at intervals, the object of controlled price may be stultified\tPrecedent\nThe controlled price will enable both the consumer and the producer to tide over difficulties\tPrecedent\ntherefore, any restriction in excess of what would be necessary in the interest of general public or to remedy the evil has to be very carefully considered so that the producer does not perish and the consumer is not crippled\tPrecedent\nThe cases of Panipat Sugar Mills and Anakapalle Co-operative Agricultural Society were distinguished on the ground that they were governed by sub-section (3C) of sec\tPrecedent\n3 of the Essential Commodities Act and therefore, had no relevance to the case before the Constitution Bench\tPrecedent\nThe case of Premier Automobiles was distinguished on the ground that the decision was rendered by invitation and on the agreement of the parties irrespective of technical and legal questions\tPrecedent\nThe Court quoted with approval a passage from Secretary of Agriculture v. Central Reig Refining Company, 330 US 604, stating: \"Suffice it to say that since Congress fixed the quotas on a historical basis it is not for this Court to reweigh the relevant factors and, per chance, substitute its notion of expediency and fairness for that of Congress\tPrecedent\nThis is so even though the quota thus fixed may demonstrably be disadvantageous to certain areas or persons\tPrecedent\nThis Court is not a tribunal for relief from the crudities and inequities of complicated experimental economic legislation\tPrecedent\nIn Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. v. Union of India, [1974] 2 SCC 630 1974 Indlaw SC 134; the Court observed, \"Price-fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even though it may be based upon objective criteria found in a report or other material\tPrecedent\nIt could not, therefore, give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price\tPrecedent\nNevertheless, the criterion adopted must be reasonable\tPrecedent\nReasonableness, for purposes of judging whether there was an \"excess of power\" or an \"arbitrary\" exercise of it, is really the demonstration of a reasonable nexus between the matters which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purposes of exercise of that power\tPrecedent\nIt was also reiterated that the decision in Shree Meenakshi Mills' case was based on a special agreement between the parties and therefore, had no relevance to the question before them\tPrecedent\nIn Prag Ice & Oil Mills v. Union of India, [1978] 3 SCC 459 1978 Indlaw SC 472 a Constitution Bench of seven judges of this court had to consider the validity of the Mustard Oil (Price Control\tPrecedent\nOrder, 1977, an Order made in exercise of the powers conferred upon Central Government by the Essential Commodities Act\tPrecedent\nChandrachud, J. speaking for the court approved the observation of Beg, CJ\tPrecedent\nin Saraswati Industrial Syndicate\tPrecedent\nthat it was enough compliance with the Constitutional mandate if the basis adopted for price fixation was not shown to be so patently unreasonable as to be in excess of the power to fix the price\tPrecedent\nHe observed: \"In the ultimate analysis the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the Executive and unless it is patent that there is hostiled discrimination against a class of operators, the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid\tPrecedent\nReferring to Shri Meenakshi Mills, the learned CJ. reaffirmed the approval accorded to the statement in Secretary of Agriculture v. Central Reig Refining Company (supra) that Courts of Law could not be converted into tribunals for relief from the crudities and inequities of complicated experimental economic legislation\tPrecedent\nPanipat Sugar and Anakappalle Society were again referred to and it was pointed out that those cases turned on the language of s. 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act\tPrecedent\nPremier Automobiles was considered and it was affirmed that the judgment in that case could not be treated as precedent and could not afford any appreciable assistance in the decision of price fixation cases as it proceeded partly on agreement between the parties and partly on concessions made at the bar\tPrecedent\nBeg, CJ. who delivered a separate opinion for himself and for Desai, J. agreed that the judgment in Premier Automobiles was not to provide a precedent in price fixation case\tPrecedent\nHe also reaffirmed the proposition that price fixation was in the nature of a legislative measure and could not give rise to a complaint that natural justice was not observed\tPrecedent\nHe indicated the indicia which led him to the conclusion that price fixation was a legislative measure\tPrecedent\nHe observed: \"We think that unless, by the terms of a 'particular statute, or order, price fixation is made a quasi-judicial function for specified purposes or cases, it is really legislative in character in the type of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation\tPrecedent\nA legislative measure does not concern itself with the facts of an individual case\tPrecedent\nIt is meant to lay down a general rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class\tPrecedent\nIn the case before us, the Control Order applies to sales of mustard oil anywhere in India by any dealer\tPrecedent\nIts validity does not depend on the observance of any procedure to be complied with or particular types of evidence to be taken on any specified matters as conditions precedent to its validity\tPrecedent\nThe test of validity is constituted by the nexus shown between the order passed and the purposes for which it can be passed, or in other words by reasonableness judged by possible or probable consequences\tPrecedent\nIn New India Sugar Works v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1981] 2 SCC 293 1981 Indlaw SC 217 there was an indication though it was not expressly so stated that the question of observing natural justice did not arise in cases of price fixation\tPrecedent\nIn Laxmi Khandsari v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1981] 2 SCC 600 1981 Indlaw SC 558 it was held that the Sugar Cane Control Order, 1966 was a legislative measure and therefore, rules of natural justice were not attracted\tPrecedent\nIn Rameshchandra Kachardas Porwal v. State of Maharashtra, [1981] 2 SCC 722 1981 Indlaw SC 423 it was observed that legislative activity did not invite natural justice and that making of a declaration that a certain place shall be a principal market yard for a market area under the relevant Agricultural Produce Markets Acts was an act legislative in character\tPrecedent\nThe observation of Magarry, J. in Bates v. Lord Hailsha, of St. Marylebone [1972\tPrecedent\n1 WLR 1973 that the rules of natural justice do not run in the sphere of legislation, primary or delegated, was cited with approval and two well known text books writers Paul Kackson and Wades H.W.R. were also quoted\tPrecedent\nThe former had said, \"There is no doubt that a minister, or any other body, in making legislation, for example, by statutory instrument or by law, is not subject to the rules of natural justice--Bates v. Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone (supra)--any more than is Parliament itself; Edinburgh and Dalkeith Rv\tPrecedent\nv. Wauchope per Lord Brougham, [1842] 8 CL & F 700, 720; British Railways Board v.

State of Madhya Pradesh, [1981] 4 SCC 471 1981 Indlaw SC 607; it was pointed out that the amendment of the Madhya Pradesh Food Stuffs Distribution Control Order was a legislative function and there was, therefore, no question of affording an opportunity to those who were to be affected by it\tPrecedent\nIn Welcom Hotel v. State of Andhra Pradesh, [1983] 4 SCC 575 1983 Indlaw SC 128 the observations of Chandrachud, CJ\tPrecedent\nin Prag Ice and Oil Mills were quoted with approval in connection with the fixation of prices of food stuffs served in restaurants\tPrecedent\nIn Tharoe Mal v. Puranchand, [1978] 1 SCC 102 1977 Indlaw SC 122 one of the questions was regarding the nature of the hearing to be given before imposing municipal taxes under the Uttar Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1916\tPrecedent\nIt was held,\tPrecedent\nthe procedure for the imposition of the tax is legislative and not quasijudicial\tPrecedent\nThe right to object, however, seems to be given at the stage of proposals of the tax only as a concession to requirements of fairness even though the procedure is legislative and not quasi-judicial\tPrecedent\nWe mentioned that the Panipat and the Anakapalle eases were distinguished in Shree Meenakshi, and Prag Ice\tRatio of the decision\nPanipat and Anakapalle were both cases where the question was regarding the price payable to a person who was required to sell to the Government a certain percentage of the quantity of sugar produced in his mill\tRatio of the decision\nThe Order requiring him to sell the sugar to the Government was made under s. 3(2)(f) of the Essential Commodities Act under which the Central Government was enabled to make an order requiring any person engaged in the production of any essential commodity to sell the whole or specified part of the quantity produced by him to the Government or its nominee\tRatio of the decision\nIt will straight-away be seen that an order under s. 3(2)(f) if a specific order directed to a particular individual for the purpose of enabling the Central Government to purchase a certain quantity of the commodity from the person holding it\tRatio of the decision\nIt is an order for a compulsory sale\tRatio of the decision\nWhen such a compulsory sale is required to be made under s. 3(2)(f), the question naturally arises what is the price to be paid for the commodity purchased\tRatio of the decision\nS. 3(3C) provides for the ascertainment of the price\tStatute\nIt provides that in calculating the amount to be paid for the commodity required to be sold regard is to be had to--(a) the minimum price, if any, fixed for sugarcane by the Central Government under this section; (b) the manufacturing cost of sugar; (c) the duty or tax, if any, paid or payable thereon; and (d) the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar\tStatute\nIt is further prescribed that different prices may be determined, from time to time, for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar\tRatio of the decision\nIt is to be noticed here that the payment to be made under s. 3(3C) is not necessarily the same as the controlled price which may be fixed under s. 3(2)(c) of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nS. 3(2)(c) of the Act, we have already seen, enables the Central Government to make an order controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold, if the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or in securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices\tStatute\nS. 3(3C) provides for the determination of the price to be paid to a person who has been directed by the Central Government by an Order made under s. 3(2)(c) to sell a certain quantity of an essential commodity to the Government or its nominee\tStatute\nWhile s. 3(2)(c) contemplates an Order of a general nature, s. 3(3C) contemplates a specific transaction\tRatio of the decision\nIf the provisions of s. 3(2)(c) under which the price of an essential commodity may be controlled are contrasted with s. 3(3C) under which payment is to be made for a commodity require to be sold by an individual to the Government, the distinction between a legislative act and a non-legislative act will at once become clear\tRatio of the decision\nThe Order made under s. 3(2c), which is not in respect of a single transaction, nor directed to particular individual is clearly a legislative act, while an Order made under s. 3(3C) which is in respect of a particular transaction of compulsory sale from a specific individual is a non-legislative act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Order made under s. 3(2)(c) controlling the price of an essential commodity may itself prescribe the manner in which price is to be fixed but that will not make the fixation of price a non-legislative activity, when the activity is not directed towards a single individual or transaction but is of a general nature, covering all individuals and all transactions\tRatio of the decision\nThe legislative character of the activity is not shed and an administrative or quasi-judicial character acquired merely because guidelines prescribed by the statutory order have to be taken into account\tRatio of the decision\nWe may refer at this juncture to some illuminating passages from Schwrtz's book on 'Administrative Law\tRatio of the decision\nHe said: \"If a particular function is termed \"legislative\" or \"rulemaking\" rather than \"judicial\" or \"adjudication,\" it may have substantial effects upon the parties concerned\tRatio of the decision\nIf the function is treated as legislative in nature, there is no right to notice and hearing, unless a statute expressly requires them\tRatio of the decision\nIf a hearing is held in accordance with a statutory requirement, it normally need not be a formal one, governed by the requirements discussed in Chapters 6 and 7\tRatio of the decision\nThe characterization of an administrative act as legislative instead of judicial is thus of great significance\tRatio of the decision\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX X\tRatio of the decision\nAs a federal court has recently pointed out, there is no \"bright line\" between rule-making and adjudication\tRatio of the decision\nThe most famous pre-APA attempt to explain the difference between legislative and judicial functions was made by Justice Holmes in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co\tRatio of the decision\nA judicial inquiry,\" said he, \"investigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist\tRatio of the decision\nThat is its purpose and end\tRatio of the decision\nLegislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power\tRatio of the decision\nThe key factor in the Holmes analysis is time: a rule prescribes future patterns of conduct; a decision determines liabilities upon the basis of present or past facts\tRatio of the decision\nThe element of applicability has been emphasized by others as the key in differentiating legislative from judicial functions\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to Chief Justice Burger, \"Rulemaking is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class\tRatio of the decision\nAn adjudication, on the other hand, applies to specific individuals or situations\tRatio of the decision\nRulemaking affects the rights of individuals in the abstract and must be applied in a further proceeding before the legal position of any particular individual will be definitely affected; adjudication operates conceretly upon individuals in their individual X X capacity\tRatio of the decision\nWe may now turn our attention to the two Drugs (prices Control) Order of 1970 and 1979, both of which were made by the Central Government in exercise of its powers under s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Drugs (prices Control) Order, 1970 defined 'Bulk Drugs' as follows: \"Bulk drugs\" means \"any unprecessed phamaceutical, chemical, biological and plant product or medicinal gas conforming to pharmacopocial or other standards accepted which is used as such or after being processed into formulations and includes an essential bulk drug\tStatute\nBulk drugs were divided into essential bulk drugs which were included in the schedule and bulk drugs which were not so included\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of essential bulk drugs, paragraph 4 of the order enabled the Central Government to fix the maximum price at which such essential bulk drugs should be sold\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of bulk drugs, which were not included in the schedule, a manufacturer was entitled to continue to market the product at the same price at which he was marketing the products at the time of the commencement of the order\tRatio of the decision\nHe was required to report this price to the Central Government within two weeks of the commencement of the order and was further prohibited from increasing the price without obtaining the approval of the Central Government\tRatio of the decision\nA Committee on Drugs and Pharmaceutical Industry, popularly known as the Hathi Committee was appointed by the Government of India to enquire into the various facets, of the Drug Industry in India\tRatio of the decision\nOne of the terms of reference was 'to examine the measures taken so far to reduce prices of drugs for the consumer, and to recommend such further measures as may be necessary to rationalise the prices of basic drugs and formulations\tRatio of the decision\nThe Hathi Committee noticed that 'in a country like India where general poverty and the wide disparities in levels of income between different sections existed' it was particularly important to emphasise 'the social utility of the industry and the urgent need for extending as rapidly as possible certain minimum facilities in terms of preventive and curative medicines to the large mass of people both urban and rural\tRatio of the decision\nIt was said, \"The concern about drug prices, therefore, really arises from the fact that many of them are essential to the health and welfare of the community; and that there is no justification for the drug industry charging prices and having a production pattern which is based not upon the needs of the community but on aggressive marketing tactices and created demand\tRatio of the decision\nThe Government of India accepted the report of the Hathi Committee and announced in Parliament the 'Statement on Drug Policy' pursuant to which the Drugs (prices Control) Order, 1970 was repealed and the Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder, 1979 was made\tRatio of the decision\nParagraph 44 of the Statement on Drug Policy in 1978 dealt with 'pricing policy' and it may be usefully extracted here\tRatio of the decision\nIt was as follows\tRatio of the decision\nThe Hathi Committee had recommended that a return post tax between 12 to 14% on equity that is paid up capital plus reserves, may be adopted as the basis for price fixation, depending on the importance and complexity of the bulk drug\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of formulations, the Hathi Committee felt that the principle of selectivity could be introduced in terms of (a) the size of the units, (b) selection of items; and (c) controlling the prices only of market leaders, in particular, of products for which price control is contemplated\tRatio of the decision\nThe Hathi Committee considered that units (other than MRTP units) having only turnover of less than Rs.1 crore may be exempted from price control\tRatio of the decision\nAlternatively, all formulations (other than those marketed under generic names) which have an annual sale in the country in excess of Rs.15 lakhs (inclusive of excise duty) may be subjected to price control, irrespective of whether or not the total annual turnover of the unit is in excess of Rs.1 crore\tRatio of the decision\nThe ceiling price will be determined taking into account the production costs and a reasonable return for the units which are the market leaders\tRatio of the decision\nYet another variant of a selectivity, according to the Hathi Committee, would be to identify product groups which individually are important and which collectively constitute the bulk of the output of the industry\tRatio of the decision\nIn respect of each item of this list, it would be possible to identify the leading producers who account for about 60% of the sales between them\tRatio of the decision\nOn the basis of cost analysis in respect of those units, maximum prices may be prescribed and all other units may be free to fix their prices within this ceiling\tRatio of the decision\nOn balance, the Hathi Committee was of the view that this particular variant selectivity may be administratively simpler\tRatio of the decision\nThe Drugs (prices Control) Order, 1979 was made pursuant to this Statement of Policy\tStatute\nParagraph 2(a) of the Drugs\tStatute\nprices Control\tStatute\nOrder, 1979 defines 'bulk drug' to mean \"any substance including pharmaceutical, chemical, biological or plant product or medicinal gas conforming to pharmacological or other standards accepted under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which is used as such or as in ingredient in any formulations\tStatute\nFormulation\" is defined as follows:- \"Formulation means a medicine processed out of, or containing one or more bulk drugs or drugs, with or without the use of any pharmaceutical aids for internal or external use for, or in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals, but shall not include-- (i) any bona fide Ayurvedic (including Sidha) or Unani (Tibb) Systems of medicine; (ii) any medicine included in the Homoeopathic system of medicine; 865 (iii) any substance to which the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (XXIII of 1940), do not apply\tStatute\nThe expressions \"free reserve\", \"leader price\", \"net-worth\", \"now bulk drug\", \"pooled price,\" \"pre-tax return\", \"retention price\" are defined in the following manner: \"\"Free reserve\" means a reserve created by appropriation of profits, but does not include reserves provided for contingent liability, disputed claims, goodwill, revaluation, and other similar reserves\". \"'leader price' means a price fixed by the Government for formulations specified in Category I, Category II or Category III of the Third Schedule in accordance with the provisions of paras\tStatute\n10 and 11, keeping in view the cost of or efficiency, or both, of major manufacturers of such formulations\tStatute\nnet-worth' means the share capital of a company plus free reserve, if any\tStatute\nnew bulk drug' means a bulk drug manufactured within the country, for the first time after the commencement of this Order\tStatute\nPooled price' in relation to a bulk drug, means the price fixed under para 7\tStatute\npre-tax return' means profits before payment of incometax and sur-tax and includes such other expenses as do not form part of the cost of formulations\tStatute\nretention price' in relation to a bulk drug means the price fixed under paras 4 and 7 for individual manufacturers, or importers, or distributors, or such bulk drugs\tStatute\nThe distinction between an essential bulk drug included in the schedule and a bulk drug not so included in the schedule, which was made in 1970 Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder was abandoned in the 1979 Order\tRatio of the decision\nBulk drugs were, however, broadly divided into indigenously manufactured bulk drugs, imported bulk drugs and hulk drugs which were both manufactured indigenously as also imported\tRatio of the decision\nParagraph 3 of the 1979 Order enables the Government, with a view to regulating the equitable distribution of any indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or the second schedule and making it available at a fair price and after making such enquiry as it deems fit, to fix from time to time by notification in the official gazette, the maximum price at which the bulk drug shall be sold\tStatute\nCl\tStatute\n2) of Paragraph 3 provides that while so fixing the price of a bulk drug, the Government may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on net worth\tStatute\nBy way of an explanation efficient manufacturer is defined to mean \"a manufacturer-(i\tStatute\nWhose production of such bulk drug in relation to the total production of such bulk drug in the country is large, or (ii) who employs efficient technology in the production of such bulk drug\tStatute\nWe have already noticed that 'net worth' is defined to mean 'the share capital of a company plus free reserve, if any'. \"Free reserve\" itself is separately defined\tStatute\nIt is then prescribed by clause (3)-- \"No person shall sell a bulk drug at a price exceeding the price notified under sub-paragraph 1, plus local taxes, if any payable: provided that until the price of bulk drug is so notified, the price of such bulk drug shall be the price which prevailed immediately before the commencement of this order and the manufacture of such bulk drug at a price exceeding the price which prevailed as aforesaid\tStatute\nThis means that until the maximum sale price of an indigenously manufactured bulk drug is fixed under paragraph 3 of the 1979 Order, the price fixed under paragraph 4 of the 1970 order or the price permitted under paragraph 5 of the 1970 order was to be maximum sale price\tRatio of the decision\nParagraph 3(4)(a) requires a manufacturer commencing production of the bulk drug specified in the First or Second Schedule, the price of which has already been notified by the Government, not to sell the bulk drug at a price exceeding the notified price\tRatio of the decision\nParagraph 3(4)(b) provides that where the price of a bulk drug has not been notified by the Government, the manufacturer shall, within 14 days of the commencement of the the production of such bulk drug, make an application to the Government in Form I and intimate the Government the price at which he intends to sell the bulk drug and the Government may, after making such an enquiry as it thinks fit, by order, fix a provisional price at which such bulk drug shall be sold\tRatio of the decision\nParagraph 4 of the 1979 order provides that notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 3, the Government may, if it considers necessary or expedient so to do for increasing the production of an indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or second schedule, by order, fix-- \"(a) a retention price of such bulk drug, (b) a common sale price for such bulk drug taking into account the weighted average of the retention price fixed under clause\tStatute\na\tStatute\nParagraph 4 is thus in the nature of an exception to paragraph 3\tRatio of the decision\nIt is meant to provide a fillip to individual manufacturers of bulk drugs whose production it is necessary to increase\tRatio of the decision\nRetention price, by its very definition pertains to individual manufacturers\tRatio of the decision\nCommon sale price, we take it, is the price at which manufacturers whose retentions are fixed may sell the bulk drug despite the maximum sale price fixed under paragraph 3\tRatio of the decision\nParagraph 5 deals with the power of the Government to fix maximum sale price of new bulk drugs\tStatute\nParagraph 6 enables the Government to fix the maximum sale price of imported bulk.drugs specified in First and Second Schedules\tStatute\nParagraph 7 deals with the power of the Government to fix retention price and pooled price for the sale of bulk drugs

provides that where any manufacturer, importer or distributor of any bulk drug or formulation fails to furnish information as required under the order within the time specified therein, the Government

bulk drug\tStatute\nThe several columns of the Form provide for various particulars to be furnished and item 18 requires the applicant to furnish ,\"the cost of production of the bulk drug as per proforma (attached) duly certified by a practising Cost/Chartered Accountant\tStatute\nThe 'proforma' requires particulars of costdata, such as, raw materials, utilities, conversion cost, total cost of production, interest on borrowings, minimum bonus, packing, selling expenses, transport charges, transit insurance charges, total cost of sales, selling price, existing price or notional or declared prices, etc\tStatute\nto be furnished\tStatute\nA note at the end of the proforma requires the exclusion from cost certain items of expenses, such as, bonus in excess of statutory minimum, bad debts and provisions, donations and charities, loss/gain on sale of assets, brokerage and commission, expenses not recognised by income tax authorities and adjustments relating to previous years\tStatute\nShri G. Ramaswamy, learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the Union of India, submitted that the fixation of maximum price under paragraph 3 of the Drugs (prices Control\tArgument\nOrder was a legislative activity and, therefore, not subject to any principle of natural justice\tArgument\nHe urged that relevant information was required to be furnished and was indeed furnished by all the manufacturers in the prescribed form as required by paragraph 3(4) of the Drugs (prices Control) Order\tArgument\nThis information obtained from the various manufacturers was taken into account and a report was then obtained from the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices, a high-powered expert body specially constituted to undertake the study of industrial cost structures and pricing problems and to advise the Government\tArgument\nIt was only thereafter that notifications fixing the prices were issued\tArgument\nHe further submitted that paragraph 27 of the Central Order gave a remedy to the manufacturers to seek a review of the order fixing the maximum price under paragraph 3\tArgument\nThe review contemplated by paragraph 27 in so far as it related to the notification under paragraph 3, it was submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General, did not partake the character of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding\tArgument\nHe urged that the manufacturers had invoked the remedy by way of review, but before the applications for review could be dealt with, they rushed to the court with the writ petitions out of which the appeal and the special leave petitions arise\tArgument\nHe urged that the Government had always been ready and wilting to give a proper hearing to the parties and in fact gave them a heating in connection with their review applications\tArgument\nThe grievance of the manufacturers in the writ petitions that they were not furnished the details of the basis of the price fixation was not correct since full information was furnished at the time of the hearing of the review applications when the matter underwent thorough and detailed discussion between the parties and the Government as well as the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices\tArgument\nThe submission of Shri Anil Diwan, learned counsel for the respondents was that unlike other price control legislations, the Drugs (prices Control) Order ,was designed to induce better production by providing for a fair return to the manufacturer\tArgument\nReference was made to the Hathi Committee report which had recommended a return of 12 to 14% post tax return on equity, that is, paid up capital plus reserves and the 'Statement on Drug Policy' which mentioned that ceiling prices may be determined by taking into account production costs and a reasonable return\tArgument\nGreat emphasis was laid on the second clause of paragraph 3 of the 1979 Order which provides that in fixing the price of a bulk drug, the Government may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on networth\tArgument\nIt was submitted that the provision for an enquiry preceding the determination of the price of a bulk drug, the prescription in paragraph 3 cl\tArgument\n2 that the average cost of production of the drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer should be taken into account and that a reasonable return on networth should be allowed and the provision for a review of the order determining the price, established that price-fixation under the Drugs (prices Control\tArgument\nOrder 2979 was a quasijudicial activity obliging the observance of the rules of natural justice\tArgument\nThe suggestion of the learned counsel was that the nature of the review under paragraph 27 was so apparently quasi-judicial and that the need to know the reasons for the order sought to be reviewed was so real if the manufacturer was effectively to exercise his right to seek the quasijudicial remedy of review, that by necessary implication it became obvious that the Order fixing the maximum price must be considered to be quasijudicial and not legislative in character\tArgument\nThe provision for enquiry in the first clause of paragraph 3 and the prescription of the matters to be taken into account in the second clause of paragraph 3 further strengthened the implication, according to the learned counsel\tArgument\nIt was contended that in any case, whatever be the nature of the enquiry and the order contemplated by paragraph 3, the review for which provision made by paragraph 27 was certainly of a quasijudicial character and, therefore, it was necessary that the manufacturers should be informed of the basis for the fixation of the price and furnished with details of the same in order that they may truly and effectively avail themselves of the remedy of review\tArgument\nIf that was not done, the remedy would become illusory\tArgument\nIt was argued with reference to various facts and figures that the price had been fixed in an arbitrary manner and the Government was not willing to disclose the basis on which the prices were fixed on the pretext that it may involve disclosure of matters of confidential nature\tArgument\nIt was stated that the applications of the manufacturers for review of the notifications fixing the prices had not been disposed of for years though time was really of the very essence of the matter\tArgument\nThe prices of formulations were dependent on the prices of drugs and it was not right that prices of formulations should have been fixed even before the applications for review against the notifications fixing the price of bulk drugs were disposed of\tArgument\nIt was suggested that the delay in disposing of the review applications had the effect of rendering the original notifications fixing the prices unreal and out of date and liable to be struck down on that ground alone\tArgument\nWe are unable to agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the respondents either with regard to the applicability of the principles of natural justice or with regard to the nature and the scope of the enquiry and review contemplated by paragraphs 3 and 27 while making our preliminary observations, we pointed out that price fixation is essentially a legislative activity though in rare circumstances, as in the case of a compulsory sale to the Government or its nominee, it may assume the character 'of an administrative or quasijudicial activity\tRatio of the decision\nNothing in the scheme of the Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder induces us to hold that price fixation under the Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder is not a legislative activity, but a quasi-judicial activity which would attract the observance of the principles of natural justice\tRatio of the decision\nNor is there anything in the scheme or the provisions of the Drugs (prices Control) Order which otherwise contemplates the observance of any principle of natural justice or kindred rule, the non-observance of which would give rise to a cause of action to a suitor\tRatio of the decision\nWhat the order does contemplate however is 'such enquiry' by the Government 'as it thinks fit\tRatio of the decision\nA provision for 'such enquiry' as it thinks fit' by a subordinate legislating body, we have explained earlier, is generally an enabling provision to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain relevant information from any source and it is not intended to vest any right in any body other than the subordinate legislating body\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case, the enquiry contemplated by paragraph 3 of Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder is to be made for the purposes of fixing the maximum price at which a bulk drug may be sold, with a view to regulating its equitable distribution and making it available at a fair price\tRatio of the decision\nThe primary object of the enquiry is to secure the bulk drug at a fair price for the benefit of the ultimate consumer an object designed to fulfil the mandate of Art\tRatio of the decision\n39(b) of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nIt is primarily from the consumer public's point of view that the Government is expected to make its enquiry\tRatio of the decision\nThe need of the consumer public is to be ascertained and making the drug available to them at a fair price is what it is all about\tRatio of the decision\nThe enquiry is to be made from that angle and directed towards that end\tRatio of the decision\nSo, information may be gathered from whatever source considered desirable by the Government\tRatio of the decision\nThe enquiry, obviously is not to be confined to obtaining information from the manufacturers only and indeed must go beyond\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, the interests of the manufacturers are not to be ignored\tRatio of the decision\nIn fixing the price of a bulk drug, the Government is expressly required by the Order to take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by 'an efficient manufacturer' and allow a reasonable return on 'net worth\tRatio of the decision\nFor this purpose too, the Government may gather information from any source including the manufacturers\tRatio of the decision\nHere again the enquiry by the Government need not be restricted to 'an efficient manufacturer' or some manufacturers; nor need it be extended to all manufacturers\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is necessary is that the average cost of production by 'an efficient manufacturer' must be ascertained and a reasonable return allowed on 'net worth\tRatio of the decision\nSuch enquiry as it thinks fit is an enquiry in which information is sought from whatever source considered necessary by the enquiring body and is different from an enquiry in which an opportunity is required to be given to persons likely to be affected\tRatio of the decision\nThe former is an enquiry leading to a legislative activity while the latter is an enquiry which ends in an administrative or quasi-judicial decision\tRatio of the decision\nThe enquiry contemplated by paragraph 3 of the Drug (Prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder is an enquiry of the former character\tRatio of the decision\nThe legislative activity being a subordinate or delegated legislative activity, it must necessarily comply with the statutory conditions if any, no more and no less, and no implications of natural justice can be read into it unless it is a statutory condition\tRatio of the decision\nNotwithstanding that the price fixation is a legislative activity, the subordinate legislation had taken care here to provide for a review\tRatio of the decision\nThe review provided by paragraph 27 of the order is akin to a post decisional hearing which is sometimes afforded after the making of some administrative orders, but not truly so\tRatio of the decision\nIt is a curious amalgam of a hearing which occasionally precedes a subordinate legislative activity such as the fixing of municipal rates etc\tRatio of the decision\nthat we mentioned earlier and a post-decision hearing after the making of an administrative or quasi-judicial order\tRatio of the decision\nIt is a hearing which follows a subordinate legislative activity intended to provide an opportunity to affected persons such as the manufacturers, the industry and the consumer public to bring to the notice of the subordinate legislating body the difficulties or problems experienced or likely to be experienced by them consequent on the price fixation, whereupon the Government may make appropriate orders\tRatio of the decision\nAny decision taken by the Government cannot be confined to the individual manufacturer seeking review but must necessarily affect all manufacturers of the bulk drug as well as the consumer public\tRatio of the decision\nSince the maximum price of a bulk drug is required by paragraph 3 to be notified any fresh decision taken in the proceeding for review by way of modification of the maximum price has to be made by a fresh notification fixing the new maximum price of the bulk drug\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words, the review if it is fruitful must result in fresh subordinate legislative activity\tRatio of the decision\nThe true nature of the review provided by paragraph 27 in so far as it relates to the fixation of maximum price of bulk drugs under paragraph 3 leader price and prices of formulations under paragraphs 12 and 13 is hard to define\tRatio of the decision\nIt is difficult to give it a label and to fit it into a pigeon-hole, legislative, administrative or quasi-judicial\tRatio of the decision\nNor is it desirable to seek analogies and look to distant cousins for guidance\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the scheme of the Control Order and the context and content of paragraph 27, the Review in so far as it concerns the orders under paragraph 3, 12 and 13 appears to be in the nature of a legislative review of legislation, or more precisely a review of subordinate legislation by a subordinate legislating body at the instance of an aggrieved person\tRatio of the decision\nOnce we have ascertained the nature and character of the review, the further question regarding the scope and extent of the review is not very difficult to answer\tRatio of the decision\nThe reviewing authority has the fullest freedom and discretion to prescribe its own procedure and consider the matter brought before it so long as it does not travel beyond the parameters prescribed by paragraph 3 in the case of a review against an order under paragraph 3 and the respective other paragraphs in the case of other orders\tRatio of the decision\nBut whatever procedure is adopted, it must be a procedure tuned to the situation\tRatio of the decision\nManufacturers of any bulk drug are either one or a few in number and generally they may be presumed to be well informed persons, well able to take care of themselves, who have the assistance of Accountants, Advocates and experts to advise and espouse their cause\tRatio of the decision\nIn the context of the Drug industry with which we are concerned and in regard to which the Control Order is made we must proceed on the basis that the manufacturers of bulk drugs are generally persons who know all that is to be known about the price fixed by the Government\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the legislative nature of the activity of the Government, it is clear that the Government is under no obligation to make any disclosure of any information received and considered by it in making the order but in order to render effective the right to seek a review given to an aggrieved person we think that the Government, if so requested by the aggrieved manufacturer is under an obligation to disclose any relevant information which may reasonably be disclosed pertaining to 'the average cost of production of the bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer' and 'the reasonable return on net worth\tRatio of the decision\nFor example, the manufacturer may require the Government to give information regarding the particulars detailed in Form No. 1 of the Fourth Schedule which have been taken into account and those which have been excluded\tRatio of the decision\nThe manufacturer may also require to be informed the elements which were taken into account and those which were excluded in assessing the 'free reserves' entering into the calculation of 'net worth\tRatio of the decision\nThese particulars which he may seek from the Government are mentioned by us only by way of illustration\tRatio of the decision\nHe may seek any other relevant information which the Government shall not unreasonably deny\tRatio of the decision\nThat we think is the nature and scope of the review contemplated by Paragraph 27 in relation to orders made under Paragraphs 3, 12 and 13\tRatio of the decision\nOn the question of the scope of a Review, the learned counsel for the respondents invited our attention to Vrajlal Manilal & Co. v. Union of India & Anr., [1964] 7 SCR 97 1964 Indlaw SC 194; Shivaji Nathubhai v. Union of India & Ors., [1960] 2 SCR 775 1960 Indlaw SC 430; Maneka Gandhi, [1978] 2 SCR 621 1978 Indlaw SC 212; Swadeshi Cotton Mills, [1981] 2 SCR 533 1981 Indlaw SC 349; and Liberty Oil Mills\tArgument\n1984] 3 SCR 676 1984 Indlaw SC 326\tArgument\nWe are afraid none of these cases is of any assistance to the correspondence since the court was not concerned in any of those cases with a review of subordinate legislation by the subordinate legislating body\tArgument\nIn Vrajlal Manilal & Co. v. Union of India & Anr. 1964 Indlaw SC 194 (supra) the court held that the Union of India when disposing of an application for review under Rule 59 of the Mines Concession Rules functioned as a quasi-judicial authority and was bound to observe the principles of natural justice\tPrecedent\nThe decision rendered without disclosing the report of the State Government and without affording reasonable opportunity to the appellants to present their case was contrary to natural justice was therefore, void\tPrecedent\nIn ShivaIi Nathubhai v. Union of India & Ors.,1960 Indlaw SC 430 (supra) it was decided by the court that the power of review granted to the Central Government under Rule 54 of the Mineral Concession Rules required the authority to act judicially and its decision would be a quasi-judicial act and the fact that Rule 54 gave power to the Central Government to pass such order as it may deem 'just and proper' did not negative the duty to act judicially\tPrecedent\nIn Maneka Gandhi's case where Bhagwati, J. while expounding on natural justice pointed out that in appropriate cases where a pre-decisional hearing was impossible, there must atleast be a post-decisional hearing so as to meet the requirement of the rule audi alteram partem\tPrecedent\nIn Swadeshi Cotton Mills, it was observed that in cases where owing to the compulsion of the fact situation or the necessity of taking speedy action, no pre-decisional hearing is given but the action is followed soon by a full post-decisional hearing to the person affected, there is in reality no exclusion of the audi alteram partem rule\tPrecedent\nIt is no adaptation of the rule to meet the situational urgency\tPrecedent\nIn Liberty Oil Mills v. Union of India 1984 Indlaw SC 326, (supra) the question arose whether clause 8B of the Import Control Order which empowered the Central Government or the Chief Controller to keep in abeyance applications for licences or allotment of imported goods where any investigation is pending into an imported goods where any investigation is pending into an allegation mentioned in cl\tPrecedent\n8 excluded the application of the principles of natural justice\tPrecedent\nThe court pointed out that it would be impermissible to interpret a statutory instrument to exclude natural justice unless the language of the instrument left no option to the court\tPrecedent\nAs we said, these cases have no application to a review of subordinate legislation by the subordinate legislating body at the instance of a party\tPrecedent\nWe mentioned that the price fixed by the Government may be questioned on the ground that the considerations stipulated by the order as relevant were not taken into account\tRatio of the decision\nIt may also be questioned on any ground on which a subordinate legislation may be questioned, such as, being contrary to constitutional or other statutory provisions\tRatio of the decision\nIt may be questioned on the ground of a denial of the right guaranteed by Art\tRatio of the decision\n14 if it is arbitrary, that is, if either the guidelines prescribed for the determination are arbitrary or if, even though the guidelines are not arbitrary, the guidelines are worked in an arbitrary fashion\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no question before us that paragraph 3 prescribes any arbitrary guideline\tRatio of the decision\nIt was, however, submitted that the guidelines were not adhered to and that facts and figures were arbitrarily assumed\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not propose to delve into the question whether there has been any such arbitrary assumption of facts and figures\tRatio of the decision\nWe think that if there is any grievance on that score, the proper thing for the manufacturers to do is bring it to the notice of the Government in their applications for review\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel argued that they were unable to bring these facts to the notice of the Government as they were not furnished the basis on which the prices were fixed\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other hand, it has been pointed out in the counter-affidavits filed on behalf of the Government that all necessary and required information was furnished in the course of the hearing of the review applications and\tRatio of the decision\nthere was no justification for the grievance that particulars were not furnished\tRatio of the decision\nWe are satisfied that the procedure followed by the Government in furnishing the requisite particulars at the time of the hearing of the review applications is sufficient compliance with the demands of fair play in the case of the class of persons claiming to be affected by the fixation of maximum price under the Drugs (prices Control) Order\tRatio of the decision\nAs already stated by us, manufacturers of bulk drugs who claim to be affected by the Drugs (prices Control\tRatio of the decision\nOrder, belong to a class of persons who are well and fully informed of every intricate detail and particular which is required to be taken into account in determining the price\tRatio of the decision\nIn most cases, they are the sale manufacturers of the bulk drug and even if they are not the sole manufacturers, they belong to the very select few who manufacture the bulk drug\tRatio of the decision\nIt is impossible to conceive that they cannot sit across the table and discuss item by item with the reviewing authority unless they are furnished in advance full details and particulars\tRatio of the decision\nThe affidavits filed on behalf of the Union of India show that the procedure which is adopted in hearing the review applications is to discuss across the table the various items that have been taken into account\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not consider that there is anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the Government\tRatio of the decision\nIf necessary it is always open to the manufacturers to seek a short adjournment of the hearing of the review application to enable them to muster more facts and figures on their side\tRatio of the decision\nIndeed we find that the hearing given to the manufacturers is often protected\tRatio of the decision\nAs we said we do not propose to examine this question as we do not want to constitute ourselves into a court of appeal over the Government in the matter of price fixation\tRatio of the decision\nhe learned counsel argued that there were several patent errors which came to light during the course of the hearing in the High Court\tArgument\nHe said that obsolete quantitative usages had been taken into consideration, proximate cost data had been ignored and the data relating to the year ending November, 1976 had been adopted as the basis\tArgument\nIt was submitted that there were errors in totalling, errors in the calculation of prices of utilities, errors in the calculation of net-worth and many other similar errors\tArgument\nAs we pointed out earlier, these are all matters which should legitimately be raised in the review application, if there is any substance in them\tRatio of the decision\nThese are not matters for investigation in a petition under Art\tRatio of the decision\n226 of the Constitution or under Art\tRatio of the decision\n32 of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nDespite the pressing invitation of Shri Diwan to go into facts and figures and his elaborate submissions based on facts and figures, we have carefully and studiously refrained from making any reference to such facts and figures as we consider it outside our province to do so and we do not want to set any precedent as was supposed to have been done in Premier Automobiles though it was not so done and, therefore, needed explanation in later cases\tRatio of the decision\nOne of the submissions of Shri Diwan was that in calculating \"net-worth\" the cost of new works in progress and the amount invested outside the business were excluded from 'free reserves' and that such exclusion could not be justified on any known principle of accountancy\tArgument\nWe think that the question has to be decided with reference to the definition of 'free reserve' in paragraph 2(g) of the Control Order and not on any assumed principle of accountancy\tRatio of the decision\nThis is also a question which may be raised before the Government in the review application\tRatio of the decision\nReferring to the 'proforma' attached to Form No. 1 of the Fourth Schedule in which are set out several items which have to be taken into account in assessing the cost of production, the learned counsel attacks the notes at the end of Item No. 14 which mentions the various items of expenses to be excluded in ascertaining the cost\tRatio of the decision\nThe notes is as follows:- \"Notes:-(i) Items of expenses to be excluded from costs-- a) Bonus in excess of statutory minimum\tRatio of the decision\nb) Bad debts and provisions\tRatio of the decision\nc) Donations and charities\tRatio of the decision\nd) Loss/Gain on sale of assets\tRatio of the decision\ne) Brokerage and commission\tRatio of the decision\nf) Expenses not recognized by Income-tax authorities (salary/prequisities, advertisements, etc\tRatio of the decision\ng) Adjustments relating to previous years\tRatio of the decision\nIn particular, he argued that Item (a) 'bonus in excess of statutory minimum' should not have been excluded so also items of expenditure coming under the other heads (b) to (g) which had been allowed by Income-tax authorities as legitimate expenses\tArgument\nHis submission was that where bonus in excess of statutory minimum was payable under the provisions of the Bonus Act there was no option left to the manufacturer not to pay the excess bonus\tArgument\nSimilarly where expenses have been legitimately incurred and allowed by Income-tax authorities, there was no justification for excluding those items of expenditure from the cost\tArgument\nWe do not agree with the submission\tArgument\nIt was open to the subordinate legislating body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production and the items to be included and excluded in so doing\tRatio of the decision\nThe subordinate legislating body was under no obligation to adopt the method adopted by the Income-tax authorities in allowing expenses for the purpose of ascertaining income and assessing it\tRatio of the decision\nThere may be many items of business expenditure which may be allowed by Income-tax authorities as legitimate expenses but which can never enter the cost of production\tRatio of the decision\nSo long as the method prescribed and adopted by the subordinate legislating body is not arbitrary and opposed to the principal statutory provisions, it cannot be legitimately questioned\tRatio of the decision\nAnother submission of the learned counsel relating to the norms for conversion costs, packing charges and process loss of raw materials and packing materials required to the notified for the purpose of calculating retail prices of formulations\tArgument\nThe argument, for example, was that there should be a more scientific formula in regard to conversion cost and not, as was done, so many rupees and paise per thousand capsules or one litre of liquid\tArgument\nIt is open to the subordinate legislating authority to adopt a rough and ready but otherwise not unreasonable formula rather than a needlessly intricate so-called scientific formula\tArgument\nWe are unable to say that the subordinate legislating authority acted unreasonably in prescribing the norms in the manner it has done\tRatio of the decision\nWhile on the question on formulations, we would like to refer to the \"Oration\" of Dr. N.H. Antia at the 24th Annual Convocation of the National Academy of Medical Sciences where he posed the question: \"Why do we produce 60,000 formulations of drugs worth Rs.2,500 crores which reach only 20% of the population when WHO recommends only 258 drugs and Rs.750 crores worth would suffice for all our people if used in an ethical manner\tRatio of the decision\nA general submission of the learned counsel was that the price of formulations should not have been prescribed until the review application filed by the manufacturer in regard to the patent bulk drugs was disposed of\tArgument\nHe submitted that the price of a formulation was dependant on the price of the bulk drug and it was, therefore, not right to fix the price of formulation when the price of bulk drug was in question in the review application and there was a prospect of the price of the bulk drug being increased\tArgument\nWe do not see any force in the submission\tRatio of the decision\nWe think that it is the necessary duty of the Government to proceed to fix the retail price of a formulation as soon as the price of the parent bulk drug is fixed\tRatio of the decision\nPrice fixation of a formulation is no doubt dependant on the price of the bulk drug, but it is not to await the result of a review application which in the end may turn out to be entirely without substance\tRatio of the decision\nIf a review application is allowed and the price of the bulk drug is raised and if in the meanwhile, the formulation had been ordered to be sold at a low price, it may result in considerable loss to the manufacturer\tRatio of the decision\nBut on the other hand, if the review application turns out to be entirely without substance and has to be rejected and if in the meanwhile the formulation is allowed to be sold at a higher price, the consumer public suffers\tRatio of the decision\nhus, the ups and downs of commerce are inevitable and it is not possible to devise a fool proof system to take care of every possible defect and objection\tRatio of the decision\nIt is certainly not a matter at which the court could take a hand\tRatio of the decision\nAll that the court may do is to direct the Government to dispose of the review application expeditiously according to a time-bound programme\tRatio of the decision\nAll that the Government may do is to dispose of the review application with the utmost expedition\tRatio of the decision\nBut as we perceive the public interest, it is necessary that the price of formulation should be fixed close on the heels of the fixation of bulk drug price\tRatio of the decision\n56\tRatio of the decision\nAnother submission of Shri Diwan was that there was considerable delay in the disposal of the review applications by the Government and that even now no orders had been passed in several cases\tRatio of the decision\nAccordingly to the learned counsel, the very delay in the disposal of review applications was sufficient to vitiate the entire proceeding and scheme of price fixation\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to the learned counsel, the price of a bulk drug is dependant on many variable factors which keep changing very fast\tRatio of the decision\nIf time is allowed to lapse whatever price is fixed, it soon becomes out of date\tRatio of the decision\nIf review applications are not disposed of expeditiously the notifications fixing the prices must be struck down as having become obsolete\tRatio of the decision\nIt is difficult to agree with these propositions\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that the price of a bulk drug is dependent on innumerable variables\tRatio of the decision\nBut it does not follow that the notification fixing the maximum price must necessarily be struck down as obsolete by the mere passage of time\tRatio of the decision\nWe agree that applications for review must be dealt with expeditiously and whenever they are not so dealt with, the aggrieved person may seek a mandamus from the court to direct the Government to deal with the review application within a time framework\tRatio of the decision\nWe notice that in all these matters, the High Court granted stay of implementation of the notifications fixing the maximum prices of bulk drugs and the retail prices of formulations\tRatio of the decision\nWe think that in matter of this nature, where prices of essential commodities are fixed in order to maintain or increase supply of the commodities or for securing the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of the commodity, it is not right that the court should make any interim order staying the implementation of the notification fixing the prices\tRatio of the decision\nWe consider that such orders are against the public interest and ought not to be made by a court unless the court is satisfied that no public interest is going to be served\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case, on ex-parte interim order was made on April 20, 1981 in the following terms: \"In the meanwhile on the petitioners' giving an undertakings to maintain prices both for bulk and formulation, as were prevailing prior to the impugned notification we stay implementation of the impugned bulk drug prices as well as formulation prices\tRuling by Lower Court\nThereafter on November 25, 1981, a further order was made to the following effect: \"After hearing learned counsel and with their consent, and arrangement has been worked out as on interim measure\tRuling by Lower Court\nWe, therefore, confirm till further orders the interim order made by us on April 20, 1981\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe terms of the said order, that is on the undertaking given on behalf of the petitioners to maintain status quo on the prices prevailing prior to the issue of the impugned notification, the petitioners, through their counsel further given an undertaking to this court that, in case the petition is dismissed and the rule is discharged, the petitioners shall within eight weeks of the dismissal of the petition by this court, deposit in this court the difference in the prices of the formulations in question for being ...... equalization account\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe petitioners, through their counsel further given an undertaking that in this court the petitioners would not contend or challenge the said amount if deposited, is not liable to be deposited under any law whatsoever\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt is made clear that the undertaking is without prejudice to the petitioners' right to take appropriate directions from the Supreme Court if so advised in this regard\tRuling by Lower Court\nNo doubt the order as made on November 25, 1981 has the manufacturers On terms, but the consumer public has been left high and dry\tRatio of the decision\nTheir interests have in no way been taken care of\tRatio of the decision\nIn matters of fixation of price, it is the interest of the consumer public that must come first and any interim order must take care of that interest\tRatio of the decision\nIt was argued by the learned counsel that the undertaking given by the parties lapsed with the disposal of the writ petition by the High Court and that it could no longer be enforced\tArgument\nWe do not agree with this submission\tRatio of the decision\nApart from the fact that an appeal is ordinarily considered to be a continuation of the original proceeding, in the present case, we notice that further orders of the Supreme Court were also in contemplation and such further orders could only be if appeals were preferred to the Supreme Court\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not think that there was any doubt in anyone's mind that the matter would be taken up in appeal to the Supreme Court whichever way the writ petitions were decided\tRatio of the decision\nWe are of the view that the undertakings given by the parties in the present cases were intended to and do continue to subsist\tRatio of the decision\nOn the conclusions arrived at by us we have no doubt that the appeal must be allowed and the writ petition in the High Court dismissed\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, we think that it is necessary to give a direction to the Government to dispose of the review applications after giving a notice of hearing to the manufacturer\tRatio of the decision\nThe hearing may be given within two months from today and the review application disposed of within two weeks after the conclusion of the hearing\tRatio of the decision\nAny information sought by the manufacturer may be given to him at the hearing in terms of what we have said in the judgment\tRatio of the decision\nThe Union of India is entitled to the costs of the appeal and the writ petition in the High Court\tRuling by Present Court\nIt appears that although several writ petitions filed by different manufacturers were disposed of by the High Court by a common judgment, the Union of India filed an appeal within the prescribed period of limitation against one of the manufacturers, Cynamide India Limited only\tRatio of the decision\nThis was apparently done under some misapprehension that it would be enough if a single appeal was filed\tRatio of the decision\nLater when it was realized that separate appeals were necessary, the Union of India filed petitions for special leave to appeal against the other manufacturers also\tRatio of the decision\nAs these petitions were filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation, petitions for condoning the delay in filing the petitions for special leave to appeal had to be and were filed\tRatio of the decision\nThese applications are strenuously opposed by the manufacturers who contend the ordinary rule which is enforced in cases of delay namely that everyday's delay must be properly explained should also be rigorously enforced against the Government\tRatio of the decision\nIt is contended that the Government is a well verse litigant as compared with private litigants and even if there is justification of adopting a liberal approach in condoning delay in the case of private litigants there was no need to adopt such approach in the case of the Government\tRatio of the decision\nIn cases like the present where parties have acted on the assumption that no appeals had been filed against them and have proceeded to arrange their affairs accordingly it would be unjust to condone the delay in filing the appeals at the instance of the Government\tRatio of the decision\nThough we see considerable force in the submission of Shri Diwan, we think that the circumstances of the instant cases do justify the exercise of our discretion to condone the delay\tRatio of the decision\nTwo important features have weighed with us in condoning the delay\tRatio of the decision\nOne is that all the writ petitions were disposed of by a common judgment and an appeal had been filed in the principal case\tRatio of the decision\nThe other is that it is a 'matter of serious concern to the public interest\tRatio of the decision\nWe, therefore, condone the delay, grant special leave in all the petitions for special leave and direct the appeals to be listed for hearing on May 1, 1987\tRuling by Present Court\nOrder accordingly\tRuling by Present Court\n"

B. Ranadive, P.W. 14 as Assistant Garrison Engineer who was to be responsible, for all the matters connected with the acquisition of land, demarcation of boundaries as an Engineer Inching for execution of the contract and responsible for the maintenance of the Air Field\tArgument\nThe work of the extension of aerodynamic was entrusted to one Telu Ram, P.W. 8 Contractor, with whom the trusted to M.E.S. Department entered into an agreement on December 3, 1962\tArgument\nThis agreement was signed both by the Appellant and P.W. 14\tArgument\nThe work according to that agreement was to be done in 2 phases-first phase was to commence on 10th January 1963 and was to be completed by 9th October 1963\tArgument\nAfter the completion of the first phase the second phase was to start on 10th October 1963 and completed by 9th May 1964\tArgument\nPursuant to this agreement it is said that -symbolic possession of the land which was acquired was taken over by the Tehsildar on 1st February 1963, after which at any rate it appears from Ex\tArgument\nP. 24 that actual possession of this land was handed over by the said Tehsildar on 13th\tArgument\nFebruary 1963 to the appellant\tArgument\nThe receipt Ex.P.24\tArgument\n24 bears the signature of N. L. Handa, the Tehsildar and of Sukhchain Lal jain, P.W. 11 on behalf of the Military Estate Officer and the Appellant\tArgument\nFrom this receipt it is evident that possession of 50.12 acres was handed over by the Tehsildar and taken over by the Appellant and the Military Estate Officer Sukhchain Lal Jain\tArgument\nThe case of the prosecution initially was that after the land so acquired with the standing crop was taken possession of by the Appellant\tFacts\nhe sold the crop to Moti Ram and Kewal Chand for Rs\tFacts\n2500 and facilitated the cutting and taking away of the crop by postponing the handing over of the possession to the contractor till the 5th April 1963 and misappropriated the money\tFacts\nIn respect of this allegation the First Information Report (Ex. P. 29) was issued on 14-1-64 in which the following statement is relevant\tFacts\nIt is alleged that Major Som Nath accused who is a Garrison Engineer Sirsa Air Field subsequently sometime in the months of March and April 1963 permitted the removal of the standing crop valued at Rs\tFacts\n11073-13 by Shri Moti Ram and Kewal Chand etc\tFacts\nafter, accepting illegal gratification of Rs. 3000 from them\tFacts\nMajor Som Nath did not account for this amount in the Govt\tFacts\nRevenues\tFacts\nHe thus. abused his position as a public servant and caused pecuniary advantage to said Shri Moti Ram and Kewal Chand by giving them standing crops worth Rs\tFacts\n13,000 for a consideration of\tFacts\nRs\tFacts\n3,000 only, which amount he accepted for his personal use and thereby also abused his official position and obtained pecuniary advantage, for himself in a sum of Rs\tFacts\nThe facts disclose the commission of the offence of criminal misconduct as defined in Section 5(1)(d) read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 by Major Som Nath accused\tStatute\nA regular case, is therefore registered and entrusted to Inspector Baldev Rai Handa for investigation\tFacts\nAfter this F.I.R. certain statements were recorded by the Military authorities being DA to DE,DM, DM/ 1, DN & DL of Mani gain, Mulkh, Raj, Ganpat Ram, Telu Ram, Kewal Chand and Sukhchain Lal Jain\tFacts\nA chargesheet was filed against the Appellant under Section 5 (1) (c) and 5 (1) (d) read with 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act on 5-8-1966 after obtaining sanction from the Govt\tFacts\nof India, Ministry of Home Affairs on llth April, 1966 as per Ex. P.23\tFacts\nThe Special Judge acquitted the Appellant of the second charge namely that being a public servant he had by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant obtained for himself a sum of Rs\tRuling by Lower Court\n2,500 from Moti Ram of Sirsa for cutting the crops and thereby committed ,offence under Section 5(1)(d) punishable under Section 5(2\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe accused was however convicted under the first charge for an offence under Section 5(1)(c) in that he being a Garrison Engineer incharge of the Air Field\tFacts\nSirsa and in that capacity entrusted with standing crops of Sarson, Gram and Lusan on 30 acres of land a part of 49 acres of land acquired by the Govt\tFacts\nand which had been valued at Rs\tFacts\n11,073.13 by the Revenue authorities, dishonestly or fraudulently allowed Moti Ram of Sirsa to misappropriate the said standing crop and thereby contravened Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act punishable with Section 5(2) of that Act\tFacts\nAgainst that conviction and sentence he -appealed to the High Court which maintained the conviction and sentence\tFacts\nThe learned Advocate for the Appellant has meticulously taken us through the entire documentary and oral evidence and commented at length upon the various contradictions and incongruities in the case of the prosecution with a view to establishing that when the Appellant took possession of the land there was no crop standing on it-that tile possession of the land 'was in fact delivered to Telu Ram, Contractor on 10-1-1963; that the said Contractor had admitted 'that possession of the entire land was received by him; that he carried on the construction work in extending the Aerodrome; that 200/250 donkeys were also used for doing the work by reason of which the crop was damaged before Tehsildar had put the Appellant in possession of the land and as a matter of fact there was no crop thereon when he got the possession of the land\tArgument\nIt was also contended that the High Court had not considered the contradictions in the earlier statement made by some of the witnesses to the Military authorities and that it relied on many of the documents for affirming the conviction of the Appellant without their actually being put to, him under Section 342\tArgument\nBefore we consider these contentions it is necessary to determine another submission of the learned Advocate for the Appellant which goes to the root of the jurisdiction of the Court to try the offence, under Section 5(1)(c\tRatio of the decision\nIf this contention is valid then the conviction of the accused cannot stand and therefore it is necessary to deal with this matter first\tRatio of the decision\nIt may be mentioned that though a complaint was made in the application for a certificate for leave to appeal to this Court that the learned Single Judge of the High Court should have acquitted the Appellant on the sole ground that there was no proper sanction for the prosecution of the Appellant under Section 5(1) (c) of the Prevention of the Corruption Act, this question does not seem to have been urged before the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn any case we do not think that there is any validity in the submission\tRatio of the decision\nthat the sanction given by the Govt\tRatio of the decision\nof India does not cover the trial of the charge under Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act\tRatio of the decision\nFor a sanction to be valid it must be established that the sanction was given in respect of the facts constituting the offence with which the accused is proposed to be charged\tRatio of the decision\nThough it is desirable that the facts should be referred to in the sanction itself, nonetheless if they do not appear on the face of it, the prosecution must establish aliunde by evidence that those facts were placed before the sanctioning authorities\tRatio of the decision\nIt is therefore necessary to first examine the order of sanction to ascertain on what facts it has been accorded\tRatio of the decision\nThe sanction that has been accorded is in the following terms: 11th April 1966\tFacts\nWhereas it is alleged that Major Som Nath...... while functioning as Garrison Engineer, M.E.S., Air Field at Sirsa from 13-2-63 to 54-1963 by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position, as such public servant, obtained pecuniary advantage of Rs\tFacts\n2500 for allowing the standing crops to be cut from the land acquired for the extension of Air Field\tFacts\nSirsa; and or he dishonestly or fraudulently realised and misappropriated Rs\tFacts\n2500 during the aforesaid period as the value of the crops cut from the land acquired for the extension of Air Field\tFacts\nSirsa, which crops had been entrusted to him as a public servant and he instead of depositing the said sale price into the Govt\tFacts\nTreasury converted it to his own use; And whereas the said acts of Major Som Nath.. constituted offences punishable under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, read With Section 5 (1) (c) and (d\tFacts\nAct No. 11 of 1947) of the said Act and Section 409 of the I.P.C\tFacts\nAnd whereas the Central Govt\tFacts\nafter fully and carefully examining the materials before it in regard to the said allegations and circumstances of the case, consider that Major Som Nath...... should be prosecuted in a court of law for the said offences\tFacts\nNow therefore, the Central Govt both hereby accord sanction under Section 197-Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 5 of 1898) and Section 6(1)(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947) for the prosecution of Maj\tFacts\nSom Nath for the said offences and for any other offences punishable under the provision of law in respect of the aforesaid acts by the Court of competent jurisdiction\tFacts\nBy order and in the name of the President. Sd/- (A. P. Veera Raghavan\tFacts\nDeputy Secretary to the Govt\tFacts\nof India\tFacts\nFrom the above order it is apparent that the facts which the Central Govt\tRatio of the decision\nconsidered for the purposes of according sanction were (a) that the Appellant as a public servant was entrusted with crops situated on the land acquired for the extension of Air Field, Sirsa ; (b) that by abusing his position as a public servant he allowed the standing crops to be cut from the said land\tRatio of the decision\nc\tRatio of the decision\nthat by corrupt or illegal means and by abusing his position as a public servant he obtained pecuniary advantage Of Rs\tRatio of the decision\n2500 as the value of the crops to be cut from the land and/or he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriated that sum by converting it into his own use instead of depositing the said sale price in the Govt\tRatio of the decision\nTreasury\tRatio of the decision\nOn these facts and after applying its mind as spoken to by P.W. 10 Kalra the Government accorded its, sanction for prosecution of the offences punishable under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(c) and 5(1)(d\tStatute\nThe question therefore Would be whether these facts were sufficient to sustain the sanction under 5(1)(c) even if the charge under 5(1)(d) had failed\tRatio of the decision\nThis question in turnwill depend upon what are the ingredients of the offences under 5(1)(c) and (d) read with Section 5(2\tRatio of the decision\nUnder 5(1)(c)-A Public servant is said to commit the offence of misconduct in the discharge of his duty if he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for' his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do, and under (d) if he by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant, obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage\tStatute\nIt would be seen therefore that under Section 5(1)(c) a public servant will be said to commit the offence of misconduct in hi& duties if he dishonestly allows any other persons to convert to his own use property Which is entrusted to the said public servant The facts which have been set out in the order granting the sanction certainly are sufficient to indicate that the authorities granting the sanction had the offence under Section 5(1)(c) also in their contemplation\tRatio of the decision\nIn fact the order specifically mentions thisprovision while granting sanction\tRatio of the decision\nWe should have thought this Was an obvious conclusion but the learned Advocate for the Appellant strenuously contended that the charge against the Appellant was of a motiveless offenceand in any case the facts as disclosed show that not only at thetime when the First Information Report was given but even at the time when sanction was accorded that the prosecution wag merely concerned with the charge that the appellant bad allowed the crops to be cut on the condition that Rs. 2500 will be paid and received the money and misappropriated or converted it tohis own use by not paying it into the Govt\tRatio of the decision\ntreasury\tRatio of the decision\nThere is therefore no basis for sanction for a charge under Section 5(1)(c\tRatio of the decision\nit is further contended that the stand taken by the prosecution was that 'the persons who we're permitted to cut the crops bad' not committed any offence\tArgument\nIf so a charge under Section 5(1)(c) would implicate those persons also in the commission of an offence which certainly would not have, been in the contemplation of the authorities granting the sanction\tRatio of the decision\nIn support of this contention three decisions have been cited before us namely Bhagat Ram v. State of Punjab  1954 Indlaw SC 188, Madan Mohan Singh V. State of U. P., Privy Council 82\tRatio of the decision\nand Gokulchand Dwarkadas Mordrka v. The King,  1948 Indlaw PC 39\tRatio of the decision\nBhagat Ram's case was not concerned with the sanction but only with the question, whether the offence could be altered to one of abetment of an offence of Section 409 I.P.C. from one under Section 409 simpliciter\tPrecedent\nIt was held that an alteration of the Appellant's conviction' under Section 409 I.P.C. into one of abetment thereof would imply a definite finding against the subordinate Judge who is not before the Court and as such it would be unfair to make such an alteration\tPrecedent\nWe do not see how this case can assist the appellant because in the first ace there is no question of an alteration, of the charge and secondly the circumstance that someone who is not a public servant abetted the appellant is hardly relevant\tRatio of the decision\nBut even so the offence with which the appellant is charged under Section 5(1)(c) does not necessarily involve ,An abetment with the person whom he had dishonestly allowed to- cut and take away the crop\tRatio of the decision\nFor instance it is quite possible that the person whom he allowed to cut the crop may be his own relation or friend in whom he may be interested and who may, however, not know that the accused was doing something dishonest in permitting him to cut the crop\tRatio of the decision\nin any case the facts which have been stated, in the sanction clearly indicate that the appellant has dishonestly allowed the crops to be cut so that there is no question of any inference or implication that the persons cutting the crops were abetting him in the offence\tRatio of the decision\nEven if it were so the sanction cannot be held to be had on that account\tRatio of the decision\nGokulchand Dwarkadas's case also is of no assistance to the appellant because in that case the sanction did not disclose the facts on which it was given but merely sanctioned the prosecution for a breach of certain provisions, Sir John Beamont delivering the Judgement of the Judicial Committee, observed at page 84: \"But if the facts constituting the offence charged are not shown on the face of the sanction, the prosecution must prove by extraneous evidence that those, facts were placed before the sanctioning authority\tPrecedent\nNor, in their Lordships' view, is a sanction given without reference to the facts constituting the offence a compliance with the actual terms of cl\tPrecedent\nUnder that clause sanction has to be given to a prosecution for the contravention of any of the provision of the Order\tPrecedent\nA person could not be charged merely with the breach of a particular provision of the Order; he must be charged with the commission of certain acts which constitute a breach, and it is to that prosecution that is for having done acts which constitution breach of the Order-that the sanction 'is required\tPrecedent\nIn the present case -there is nothing on the face ,of the sanction, and no extraneous evidence, to show that the sanctioning authority knew the facts alleged to constitute a breach of the Order, and the sanction is invalid\tPrecedent\nThe case of Jaswant Singh v. The State of Puniab\tPrecedent\n1957 Indlaw SC 59 was also cited by the Respondent's advocate in support of the contention that the trial of two offences requiring sanction was not valid\tPrecedent\nIn that case sanction was given under Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 47 for the prosecution of the appellant for having received illegal gratification from one Pal Singh\tPrecedent\nHe was charged with and tried for two offences under Section 5(1) (a) of the Act for habitually accepting or obtaining illegal gratification and under Section 5(1)(d) for receiving illegal gratification from Pal Singh\tPrecedent\nThe Session Judge had found that both charges were proved\tPrecedent\nWhile in Appeal the High Court held that the Appellant could neither be tried nor convicted of the offence under 5(1)(a) as no sanction had been given in respect of it but upheld the conviction under Section 5(1)(d) for which sanction had been given\tPrecedent\nA perusal of the sanction would show that the sanctioning authority had applied their mind to only one instance but the prosecution were seeking to make the sanction cover the offence of a habitual bribe taker which clearly implies that the sanctioning authorities must consider the number of instances when the accused took bribes and on what occasions as would justify a charge of his being a habitual bribe taker\tPrecedent\nSinha, J, as he then was while dismissing the appeal observed at page 766\tPrecedent\nIn the present case the sanction strictly construed indicates the consideration by the sanctioning authority of the facts relating to the receiving of the illegal gratification from Pal Singh and therefore the appellant could only be validly tried for that offence\tPrecedent\nThe contention that a trial for two offences requiring sanction is wholly void, where the sanction is granted for one offence and not for the other, is in our opinion unsustainable\tPrecedent\nSection 6(1) of the Act bars the jurisdiction of the Court to take cognizance of an offence for which previous sanction is required and has not been given\tPrecedent\nThe prosecution for offence under S. 5(1)(d) therefore is not barred because the proceedings are not without previous sanction which was validly given for the offence of receiving a bribe from Pal Singh, but the offence of habitually receiving illegal gratification could not be taken cognizance of and the prosecution and trial for that offence was void for want-of sanction which is a condition precedent for the Courts taking cognizance of the offence alleged to be committed and therefore the High Court has rightly set aside the conviction for that offence\tPrecedent\nThese cases instead of supporting the contention of the learned Advocate amply demonstrate that the facts which formed the basis of the sanction and which was accorded after the sanctioning authority had fully applied its mind to them, should be correlated to the particular offence or offences with which the accused is charged or convicted\tRatio of the decision\nIn our view there is no justification for holding that the conviction under Section 5(1)(c) read with 5(2) is bad for want of the requisite sanction\tRatio of the decision\nNow on the merits of the case as we said earlier the learned Advocate for the appellant has referred to the evidence in meticulous detail and has commented thereon, at length but this Court ordinarily does not reappropriation the evidence with a view to arriving at its own finding as if it was a Court of fact and does not ordinarily upset the findings of the High Court which has on an evaluation of the evidence affirmed the trial court's conviction and sentence\tRatio of the decision\nIt has been contended firstly that the High Court was in error in relying on certain evidence for convicting the accused which was not put to him\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly the evidence that was necessary to unfold the story of the prosecution has not been produced by the prosecution but the Trial Court and the High Court ignored this lacunas in the prosecution case\tRatio of the decision\nThirdly the Judgments show that there was utter confusion in respect of the date on which possession of the acquired land was given to the Appellant and the date on which it was given to the Contractor for carrying on the work, as also in respect of the fact whether there was any crop standing when the Appellant took possession of the land and at what period of time the crop was cut and the work commenced\tRatio of the decision\nBefore we deal with the contentions urged on behalf of the Appellant it is necessary to have a clear picture of certain broad features of the case\tRatio of the decision\nThe Air strip which was being extended is in one straight line with Taxi-ways\tRatio of the decision\nP.W.14 Ranadive tells us that if one were to go from the entrance of Air Field to the acquired land one would have to pass through RD 4500 to 1200\tRatio of the decision\nThe acquired land extended from RD 1200 to RD 00\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to P.W. 8 Telu Ram, he acquired possession of the land of the length from RD 4500 to RD 1200 on 10th January 1963 and that tile possession of the acquired land was not delivered to him as it had not been acquired by that time\tRatio of the decision\nEx\tRatio of the decision\nDO review report which is headed Technical Administration Contract shows that the date of review was 9th February 1963\tRatio of the decision\nIn this document the date of the conclusion of the contract is given as 3rd December'62 and date of commencement of work as 10th January'63, date of completion of 1st phase 9th October, '63 and second phase 9th May 1964\tRatio of the decision\nTo the Question \"Have all sites- been handed over on due date\" the answer shown- was an affirmative 'yes\tRatio of the decision\nThere is However nothing in this document to show what is the site of' which possession was handed over to and taken by Telu Ram on 10th January '63\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not the case of the Appellant that acquisition of the land on which the crop was standing had taken place nor could possession of it been handed over to him because he denies that there was any crop on the land when the possession of the land was handed over to him\tRatio of the decision\nThat there was crop on 'the land is amply born out by a letter of the Appellant dated 12th February 1963 addressed to Mr. G. L. Nagpal, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Sirsa\tRatio of the decision\nIn this letter he says: - \"12th Feb. 1963\tRatio of the decision\nMy dear Mr. Nagpal, I am writing to you With regard to\tRatio of the decision\nacquisition of land for Sirsa Airfield\tRatio of the decision\nAs, you know\tRatio of the decision\nthe Additional Deputy Commissioner, Hissar will be visiting his location on 13th Feb. 1963\tRatio of the decision\nThe Military Estates Officer, Delhi, Mr. K. K. Gamkhar will also be here on 13th morning\tRatio of the decision\nIt is desirable that entire proceedings With regard to acquisition of land and determining compensation for standing crops for the total area of 39.58 acres in Mirpur and Ahmadpur villages tire finalised an this date\tRatio of the decision\nAs I have told you personally, we are keen to finalise the proceedings for the total area to be acquired by us and not by phses\tRatio of the decision\nThis is interest of the project\tRatio of the decision\nI therefore request you to issue suitable instructions to, your staff so that all the relevant papers may be suitably prepared\tRatio of the decision\nEven if Exhibit DQ gave a correct picture, it could be in relation to the airstrip already in existence, as this would be necessary for a contractor who is charged with duty to carry out extension work to go on the site collect materials and get everything ready to execute his contract\tRatio of the decision\nIn fact as we have noticed earlier this is what Telu Ram says in his evidence, namely that on loan January'63 no delivery of possession of the remaining land other than RD 4500 to 1200 (the land in which there is the existing run-way) was given\tRatio of the decision\nIt was then that he wrote on 23-1-1963 as per Ex. 8 to the Assistant Garrison Engineer complaining that the possession of the whole of the land had not been delivered to him\tRatio of the decision\nA copy of this letter was sent to the Garrison Engineer-the Appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThis letter shows two things (a) that complete site 4500 to 0 ft. has not yet been handed over \"as it was presumed that the possession of the land could not be had so for\" and (b) that as levels have not been given, the final excavation of the foundation cannot be done and all subsequent operations are therefore withheld\tRatio of the decision\nThis letter clearly indicates that some excavation was being done as otherwise there is no meaning in saying that final excavation cannot be done\tRatio of the decision\nThis Is also consistent with the other evidence that some work was in progress Which gain is in accord with the evidence of Telu Ram P.W. 8 that he got the possession of RD 4500 to RD 1200\tRatio of the decision\nThe extension of the Airstrip would mean that the existing Airstrip is being extended, so that the initial work can be started and continued on the existing Airstrip\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not as if the existing Airstrip ends at the boundary of RD 4500 to RD 1200, so that the work of extension can go on in the existing Airstrip even before possession of the acquired land was given\tRatio of the decision\nThis is further confirmed by a perusal of the letter written by the Appellant to Telu Ram P.W. 8 in reply to his letter dated 28th February'63 (not produced) that \"Necessary possession of the, runway and taxi track has already been given to you\tRatio of the decision\nYou are therefore requested to set out the work and get the same approved by the Engineerin- charge before starting the work\tRatio of the decision\nThis shows that no work had in fact been undertaken on the land acquired and also that possession of the existing runway and track had already been given\tRatio of the decision\nNothing is specifically mentioned about possession of the acquired land being given to him on that date\tRatio of the decision\nThe work on that land is only at the stage of getting approval\tRatio of the decision\nNow the next question is When was the possession of the acquired land obtained by the Appellant and when did he deliver it to P.W. 8\tRatio of the decision\nP.W. 14, says that symbolic possession was delivered to him in respect of the acquired land on the 1st February'63\tRatio of the decision\nIt would however appear from Exh\tRatio of the decision\nP. 24 that actual possession was delivered to the Appellant on 13th February '63 as per the delivery receipt executed by him, the Tehsildar and P.W.11, a representative of the Military Estate office and that even according to his letter already referred to Ex\tRatio of the decision\nP.13 there wag standing crop on the land\tRatio of the decision\nas otherwise there is no meaning in the Appellant saying therein that it is desirable that entire proceedings with regard to acquisition of land and determining compensation for standing crops for' the 'total area of 39- 58 acres are finalised on the 13th February\tRatio of the decision\nThere is also credible evidence that possession of the acquired land was not handed over to the contractor till late in, March '63 though, it was handed over to and, taken over by the Appellant on 13-2-63\tRatio of the decision\nThe Khasra Girdawari Ex\tRatio of the decision\nP.3 would show that there was a crop of Sargon (Mustard) Gram and Lusan, at any rate on 20th March 63 at a time when the land has been shown therein to have been in possession of the Military authorities\tRatio of the decision\nP. 2 is a certified copy by the Tehsildar dated 18-9-63 which shows that as per the Girdawari on 20-3-63 crops were standing on the lands in the village Ahmedpur acquired by the Military authorities for Sirsa 3 Airfield construction, the details of which were that the total land acquired for Airfield 49 acres, the land on which crops were standing in good condition 23 acres and the land on which crops were standing in damaged condition 7 acres and uncultivated land 19 acres\tRatio of the decision\nMani Ram Patwari had stated that by the 20th March 1963 some ground had been cleared\tRatio of the decision\nSukhchain Lal Jain P.W. 11 who had also come to obtain possession on behalf of the Military Estate Officer had said that he had seen some part of the crops had been cut by 13-2-1963, but was not aware who had cut them\tRatio of the decision\nThis evidence, however, does not assist the accused\tRatio of the decision\nAt the most it shows that a small portion of the crops were cut but it is apparent that that has not been taken into account by the Collector in assessing the value of the crop because it is on that day that crops were inspected for that purpose and subsequently the Agricultural Officer also had in his letter dated 18-2-63, which has been cited in the award Ex\tRatio of the decision\nP. 26 intimated that on inspection the crops were found to be very good\tRatio of the decision\nHe had also given the approximate yield and the rate at which the crop can be valued with which the Collector agreed and awarded compensation\tRatio of the decision\nIt is therefore clear that in estimating the crop, the small portion of the land where crops were stated to have been cut by the 13-2-63 even if true could not have been taken into account\tRatio of the decision\nIt may also be stated that the Contractor had written to the, Garrison Engineer on 28-2-63 requesting him to hand over immediately the possession of the remaining portion of the land so that excavation work is not held up\tRatio of the decision\nHe also inform in that letter that the excavation in all available portions of the taxi track and runway has been completed\tRatio of the decision\nThis again does not specifically refer to the land which is being acquired\tRatio of the decision\nAt any rate on the 23rd March, 1963 P.W. 8 has again written to the Garrison Engineer namely the Appellant that the excavation of the taxi track could not be proceeded with for want of alignment to be given which was pending for want (because) of standing crops, in the land, the possession of which has not been given so far\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter the following pertinent statement appears namely- \"Now, today I find that the crops have been completely cut and as such it is requested that further necessary action in the matter of giving the alignment and possession of land may please be taken at your end\tRatio of the decision\nOn the 6th April, 1963 he has again written to the Garrison Engineer saying as follows\tFacts\nYou have verbally asked me now to take the site after the crop is cut and the necessary marking of the alignment has been taken in hand but this handing over has not been shown on the site order book by the A.G.E. (B/R) despite my request\tFacts\nHe may please be asked to complete this formality without any loss of time\tFacts\nIn reply the Appellant states in his letter Ex\tFacts\nP. 12 dated the 10th April\tFacts\nThe matter has already been discussed with you and finalised\tFacts\nNo further action is required to be taken\tFacts\nIt can be seen from the above that the appellant is reluctant to reply in writing as to what he is asking the contractor to do under verbal orders while the contractor for safeguarding his position is insisting on having it in writing\tRatio of the decision\nThe Trial Court as well as the High Court are in our view, justified in holding that crops of Sarson, gram and lusan were standing on the land acquired by the Military for extension of the Aerodrome\tRatio of the decision\nIt will also justify the conclusion that they were there at any rate till the 20th March 1963 and according to the letter of the contractor (P.W. 8) on 23-3-63 they were completely cut\tRatio of the decision\nIn so far as handing over of the possession of the land to the Contractor (P.W. 8) is concerned, the Trial Court and the High Court are equally justified in coming to the conclusion that the accused had not delivered the possession of the land to the contractor till quite late as would appear from the letter of P.W. 8 dated the 5th April, 1963\tRatio of the decision\nWe are aware of the argument addressed before us that some of the witnesses had said that the water channels had been closed in February 1963 and therefore no crop could thereafter have been standing on the land and must have been destroyed\tRatio of the decision\nThere is also the further argument that some of the statements recorded by the Military authorities were not taken into account, as the High Court had thought that since the deponents denied the contents the officers who recorded the statement might have been called to show that they were properly recorded\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned advocate for the respondent also tried to support the stand taken by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nIt 1is true that when a witness has admitted having signed his previous statements that is enough to prove that some statement of his was recorded and he had appended his signature thereto\tRatio of the decision\nThe only question is, what use can be made of such statements even where the witness admits having signed the statements made before the Military Authorities\tRatio of the decision\nThey can at best be used to contradict in the cross-examination of such a witness when he gives evidence at the Trial Court of the accused in the manner provided under Section 145 of 'the Evidence Act\tStatute\nIf it is intended to 'contradict the'- witness by the writing, the attention of the witness should be called before the writing can be proved to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him\tRatio of the decision\nIf this is not done, the evidence of the witnesses cannot be assailed in respect of those statements by merely proving that the witness had signed the document\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the witnesses are contradicted by their previous statements in the manner aforesaid, then that part of the statements which has been put to the witness will be considered along with the evidence to assess the worth of the witness in determining his veracity\tRatio of the decision\nThe whole of the previous statement however cannot be treated as substantive evidence\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not find that the assessment of the evidence by the Trial Court and the High Court even in the light of such of those previous statements that have been put to the witnesses in the manner stated above is in any way unjustified\tRatio of the decision\nIt is said that some of the documents i.e. Ex. 8, 10 and 11 have not been put to the witnesses even though the Court relied upon them\tRatio of the decision\nP.8\tRatio of the decision\nas already noticed is the letter of Telu Ram Jain to the Assistant Garrison Engineer and P. 10 is the letter of Telu Ram Jain to the Garrison Engineer\tRatio of the decision\nBoth these related to possession of the acquired land not being given to him\tRatio of the decision\nIn the examination of the accused under Section 342 the Special Judge in our view did put all the circumstances against the accused which formed the basis of the conviction\tRatio of the decision\nHe was asked about the symbolic delivery of possession, the handing over of the actual possession of the land on 13-2-63 and the existence of crops on the date when possession was delivered on 16-2- 63\tRatio of the decision\nHe was asked about Telu Ram's evidence and also that he had given possession of the land RD 1200 to RD 00 to the contractor after the crop had been cut\tRatio of the decision\nThe letter Ex. P. 13 was also put to him and he was asked about the existence of the crops\tRatio of the decision\nIt cannot, therefore be said that circumstances appearing against the accused which have formed the basis of the conviction had not been put to him\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant has denied that there was any standing crop on the land acquired on any date after 13-2-63\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other hand, he emphatically asserted that at the time when the possession was delivered to him on 13-2-63 there was also no crops standing on the acquired land\tRatio of the decision\nThis statement is clearly false as it is against credible documentary evidence at a time when there was no possibility of any charge being levied against the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also incorrect because the ,contractor did not work on the acquired land since 1-2- 63 that position is reflected in the review report initiated by the A.G.E. on 9-2-63 (vide Ex. DQ\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant's statement is therefore belied by the documentary evidence which shows unmistakably that there was on 13-2-63 bumper crops of different varieties standing,on the land which was valued thereafter and compensation assessed\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not therefore think that there is any justification in the criticism that circumstances appearing in the several documents have not been put to him\tRatio of the decision\nIt is lastly contended that certain witnesses who would be necessary to unfold the prosecution story have not been called and.in spite of the Court directing the production, of the usufruct register it was not produced\tArgument\nThese omissions it is submitted by the learned advocate has prejudiced the accused\tArgument\nAs the learned advocate for the respondent rightly pointed out with reference to each one of the persons who, it was claimed, should have been called, that there was already evidence relating to the particular matter about which the person specified was sought to be called\tRatio of the decision\nFor instance, it is said that Gamkhar, Military Estate officer was not produced to prove the receipt Ex\tRatio of the decision\nP. 24\tRatio of the decision\nBut this was not necessary because Gamkhar was not present nor did he sign the receipt\tRatio of the decision\nThe person who had signed the receipt is Sukhchain Lal Jain and he was examined as P.W. 11\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly, it is said that the Tehsildar N. L. Handa has not been produced\tRatio of the decision\nBut when the prosecution relies upon the proof of Ex\tRatio of the decision\nP. 24 as also to establish that there was standing crops on the land when the possession was delivered on 13-2-63 on certain witnesses who were present on the respective occasions\tRatio of the decision\nthe nonexamination of other witnesses without anything more cannot be treated as defect in the prosecution\tRatio of the decision\nBefore the High Court also this grievance was aired but that Court also likewise found no justification in it\tRatio of the decision\nWe are therefore not impressed with this argument\tRatio of the decision\nOn' a careful consideration of the evidence both oral and documentary it is established that the Appellant who was in charge of the expansion work on the air-strip was given possession of the land acquired for that purpose on 13-2-63, that there was standing thereon, a bumper crop of Sarson, gram and Lusan on that day, that he was therefore entrusted with this crop, that he postponed giving delivery of the land to the contractor till, at any rate after the 23rd March, 1963 and before the 6th April, 1963 and that he allowed the crop to be cut and taken away without in any way accounting for it which shows that it was done dishonestly and raudulently\tRuling by Present Court\nThe fact that otwithstanding overwhelming evidence particularly of his own admission at the time he denies that there were ever any crops when delivery of possession of the land acquired was taken by him, further reinforces the conclusion that he allowed the crops to be cut away with dishonest or fraudulent motive\tRuling by Present Court\nWe do not think in these circumstances there is any justification whatever for interfering with the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and the High Court that the Appellant is guilty of an offence under Section 5(1)(c) read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and consequently the appeal is dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

of implementation of the Scheme issued a notice u/s.67 of the Act upon the respondent no.4 on or about 15.01.2000.As he did not respond thereto,a notice u/s.68 of the Act was served on him on 31.03.2000 stating: \"As per the said approved preliminary scheme the plot No.157 is allotted to you\tFacts\nAnd,its pole demarcations were done by the town planning officer at site\tFacts\nThe said Final Plot/ Original Plot is allotted in lieu of your No.17/7,17/8 paiki land\tFacts\nAnd,the said land is now vested in the Municipal Corporation from 1.7.1999,and is of the ownership of the Municipal Corporation\tFacts\nThereafter the notice below s.67 for the change in occupation was issued on 15.1.2000 to you\tFacts\nIn spite of this you have not handed over the possession\tFacts\nTherefore,as per the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules,1979 rule 33 the undersigned in exercise of powers conferred below s.68(1) and 8(2) of the Bombay Provincial Municipalities Act and below the s.68 notice under the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act this is to inform you that as shown in the sketch on the reverse the premises marked should be vacated within 7 days from receipt of the notice and had over the possession to the Surat Municipal Corporation\tFacts\nIf you fail to do so then on completion of the stipulated time limit as per the Rule 33 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules,1979 the said land and the occupation on the same will be summarily evicted and your occupation will be removed and if you obstruct/ interfere on it after taking away the possession you trespass then as provided under Rule 33 of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules,1979\tFacts\nthe Action as per the s.188 of the Indian Penal Code will be initiated against you before the Criminal Court,pleased take note of the same\tFacts\nThe validity and/ or legality of the said notice was questioned by the appellant by filing a writ petition in the High Court of Gujarat inter alia contending that the purported final allotment of plot No.165 in favour of the respondent no.3 and allotment of final plot No.157 in favour of the respondent no.4 were made without issuing any notice as envisaged u/ss.52 and 53 of the Act\tFacts\nIn the said writ petition,it was prayed: \" On the facts and circumstances mentioned herein above,the Petitioner prays to your Lordships that: (A) Be pleased to issue writ of Mandamus or writ in the nature of Mandamus or appropriate writ,order or direction,quashing and setting aside the impugned action of acquiring and demolishing the structures available on the land in question,i.e.,Original Plot No.17/A -R.S.No.17/P,situated at Umra,Surat\tFacts\nA learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the said writ petition inter alia opining that the interest of landlord and tenant being common and in absence of any inter se dispute between them even if any portion of the land which remained in possession of the tenant was included in the Scheme,the proper remedy would be to claim compensation to that extent,holding: \" It appears that in the said decision,the Apex Court while considering the scheme on the touch-stone of the mandatory procedure to be followed by the authority under the Bombay Town Planning Rules,has given directions to provide alternative accommodation based on the earlier decision in case of Jaswantsingh Mathurasingh and upheld the scheme\tRuling by Lower Court\nSuch is not the issue in the present case nor there is any complaint by the tenant that any special notice was not served or that the mandatory procedure for finalization of the scheme is not followed\tRuling by Lower Court\nFurther,it appears that if the interest of the landlord and of the tenant is common and in absence of any inter se dispute between the landlord and tenant,even if any portion of the land which is in possession of the tenant is included in the scheme,the proper remedy for the tenant would be to claim for compensation to that extent and if such compensation is not received by him,he may resort to proper remedy available for recovery of the compensation to the extent of the area in his occupation\tRuling by Lower Court\nAt least on ground that the tenant is in occupation,it would not be a case for interference with the scheme which is sanctioned and made a part of the statute\tRuling by Lower Court\nSuffice it to say that the tenant will be at liberty to resort to appropriate proceedings against the landlord for the inter se rights and also for entitlement of the compensation\tRuling by Lower Court\nBut if the area of original plot no.17/8 is included in the final scheme and in exchange of the original plot held by Keshav Gramini of 17/8 and 17/7,the final plot is already allotted and as observed earlier it was even otherwise in the ownership of the original holder and it is only on account of inter se dispute the other persons are lawfully occupying the land,the tenant cannot insist that his landlord must be allotted the land of final plot no.157 simultaneously,when he is to be evicted or deprived of the portion of the land of original plot no.17/8.Therefore,in my view considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case,the decision of the Apex Court in case of Mansukhlal1991 Indlaw SC 975 (supra) cannot be made applicable to the present case\tRuling by Lower Court\nA Division Bench of the High Court dismissed an intra-court appeal preferred thereagainst\tFacts\nMr.U.U.Lalit,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant,in support of this appeal,inter alia would submit: \"(i\tArgument\nThe provisions of Ss.52 and 81 being imperative in character,no acquisition of land is permissible without service of any notice upon the persons interested which would include a tenant in occupation and carrying on business thereon\tArgument\nii\tArgument\nA tenant having regard to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or otherwise having an interest in the property cannot be deprived therefrom without following

concerned for three purposes: \"(i) in regard to draft scheme; (ii) lodging of any claim for payment of compensation; (iii) participation in the matter of allotment of final plots\tRatio of the

the Bombay Rules was mandatory in nature,subject,of course,to the condition that on the crucial date,viz.,when the Town Planning Scheme is notified in the official gazette,he,whether an owner or tenant or sub-tenant,must be in possession of the property\tRatio of the decision\nIn Jaswantsingh Mathurasingh1991 Indlaw SC 972 (supra),it was reiterated that a tenant or a sub-tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice\tPrecedent\nIn that context,it was held: \"The question is whether the tenant or a sub-tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice\tPrecedent\nIt is obvious that u/s.105 of Transfer of Property Act,a lease creates right or an interest in enjoyment of the demised property and a tenant or a sub-tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the demised property until the lease is duly terminated and eviction takes place in accordance with law\tPrecedent\nTherefore,a tenant or a sub-tenant in possession of a tenement in the Town Planning Scheme is a person interested within the meaning of Rules 21(3) and (4) of the Rules\tPrecedent\nBut he must be in possession of the property on the crucial date i.e.when\tPrecedent\nthe Town Planning Scheme is notified in the official Gazette\tPrecedent\nEvery owner or tenant or a sub-tenant,in possession on that date alone shall be entitled to a notice and opportunity\tPrecedent\nRule 21(3),however,of the Bombay Rules has been amended in tune with Rule 26 of the Rules\tStatute\nAmended rules are in pari materia with Rule 26 of the Rules\tStatute\nAppellant was a tenant in respect of plot No.17/8.Plot No.17/7 was not a plot contiguous thereto\tFacts\nThey were separated not only by a road but also by various other plots\tFacts\nIt is also not in dispute that the appellant filed an objection in regard to the draft scheme but did not eventually pursue the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe draft scheme was approved.867 sq.m.of land had been acquired for public purpose out of the said plot No.17/8.While the proceedings relating to allotment of final plot were in progress,he even did not file any objection thereto\tRatio of the decision\nIf he intended to claim any interest in a portion of plot No.17/8 either for the purpose of obtaining compensation for acquisition of a part of the land or to continue to have possession over 200 sq.m.of land in plot No.17/8,it was obligatory on his part to take part in the proceedings\tRatio of the decision\nWhether irrespective of Rule 26 of the Rules which prescribes for issuance of a general public notice,any special notice upon the appellant was required to be served by the State or by the authority,in our opinion,cannot be gone into by us in these proceedings for the first time\tRatio of the decision\nValidity of Rule 26 of the Rules had never been questioned\tRatio of the decision\nIt had also not been contended that the said Rule is ultra vires S.52 of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nA person interested in continuing to keep possession over a property and/ or a part of the amount of compensation must lay his claim before the appropriate authority at the appropriate stage\tRatio of the decision\nIf in absence of any such claim filed by the appellant,the authorities have proceeded to finalise allotment of final plot in favour of the respondent Nos.3 and 4 herein,it is too late in the day to contend that the entire scheme should be re-opened\tRatio of the decision\nWe would consider the effect of Sub-s.(3) of S.65 of the Act a little later,but,we may at this juncture notice that the respondent No.3 in whose favour plot No.165 has been allotted which includes 200 sq.m.of land purported to be in possession of the appellant had nothing to do with the dispute between the appellant and his landlord the respondent no.4.Respondent No.4 was in possession of a contiguous plot\tRatio of the decision\nRespondent No.4 was owner of both plot\tRatio of the decision\nNos.17/7 and 17/8.He was,therefore,in his own right entitled to final allotment of some plot\tRatio of the decision\nWe would,however,assume that it was obligatory on the part of the State to serve a special notice upon the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe question,however,would be : what would be the consequence of non-compliance thereof vis-'-vis the conduct of the appellant himself\tRatio of the decision\nA

that the requirements in regard to the manner of service of notice varies from statute to statute and there exists a difference between the Bombay Rules and the Rules\tRatio of the decision\nWe

purpose and increase in the valuation of the property was admitted\tRatio of the decision\nThere exists a distinction in the Action of the planning authority as regards vesting of a property in it and one so as to enable it to create a third party interest vis-'-vis for the purpose of re-allotment thereof\tRatio of the decision\nIn the former case,the vesting of the land may be held to be an act of acquisition,whereas in the latter,it would be distribution of certain benefits having regard to the purpose sought to be achieved by a statute involving town planning\tRatio of the decision\nIt was on that legal principle,this Court in State of Gujarat v\tRatio of the decision\nShantilal Mangaldas & Ors.[1969 (3) SCR 341 1969 Indlaw SC\tRatio of the decision\n254],opined that when a development is

appropriate authority free from all encumbrances with effect from the date on which the preliminary scheme comes into force\tStatute\nWhat would be the quantum of payment of compensation therefor is also provided in S.82 of the Act\tStatute\nIt is in the aforementioned situation,a claim is to be made before the authority whenever a notice in Form H is published\tStatute\nIf a claim is not filed,the person,who is said to be injuriously affected,does so at its own peril\tStatute\nHad such a claim been filed,the authority before making final allotment could have considered the competing claims wherefor a large number of factors were required to be taken into consideration,viz.,the location of the land,the area of the land,the nature of right,etc\tStatute\nWhen a statute makes an elaborate provision as regards the formalities required to be undergone at every stage by the local authority,the State Government and other authorities concerned in preparing and making the final

assert his purported right to special notice in respect of the final allotment in the instant case given the fact that he did not pursue his objections to the draft scheme and subsequently did not object/participate during the proceedings for re-allotment\tRatio of the decision\nIt has been noticed by us hereinbefore that under Rule 26 of the Rules applicable in the instant case,as distinguished from the Bombay Rules (wherein special notice is required),no special notice is mandatorily required to be served\tRatio of the decision\nAssuming,however,that it was obligatory for the State to issue notice to the appellant,the question is whether the principle of waiver precludes him from claiming equitable relief in this case due to his earlier conduct which allowed the entire process of acquisition and allotment to become final\tRatio of the decision\nWe are of the opinion that even if he had any such right,he waived the same\tRatio of the decision\nIn Halsbury's Laws of England,Volume 16(2),4th edition,para 907,it is stated: \"The expression 'waiver' may,in law,bear different meanings\tRatio of the decision\nThe primary meaning has been said to be the abandonment of a right in such a way that the other party is entitled to plead the abandonment by way of confession and avoidance if the right is thereafter asserted,and is either express or implied from conduct\tRatio of the decision\nIt may arise from a party making an election,for example whether or not to exercise a contractual right\tRatio of the decision\nWaiver may also be by virtue of equitable or promissory estoppel; unlike waiver arising from an election,no question arises of any particular knowledge on the part of the person making the representation,and the estoppel may be suspensory only\tRatio of the decision\nWhere the waiver is not express,it may be implied from conduct which is inconsistent with the continuance of the right,without the need for writing or for consideration moving from,or detriment to,the party who benefits by the waiver,but mere acts of indulgence will not amount to waiver; nor may a party benefit from the waiver unless he has altered his position in reliance on it\tRatio of the decision\nAs early as 1957,the concept of waiver was articulated in a case involving the late assertion of a claim regarding improper constitution of a Tribunal in Manak Lal v\tPrecedent\nDr\tPrecedent\nPrem Chand [AIR 1957 SC 425 1957 Indlaw SC 159] in the following terms\tPrecedent\nIt is true that waiver cannot always and in every case be inferred merely from the failure of the party to take the objection\tPrecedent\nWaiver can be inferred only if and after it is shown that the party knew about the relevant facts and was aware of his right to take the objection\tPrecedent\nAs Sir Johan Romilly M.R.has observed in Vyvyan v\tPrecedent\nVyvyan\tPrecedent\n1861] 30 Beav.65 : 54 E.R.813,817] \"waiver or acquiescence,like election,presupposes that the person to be bound is fully cognizant of his rights,and,that being so,he neglects to enforce them,or chooses one benefit instead of another,either,but not both,of which he might claim\tPrecedent\nIn The Director of Inspection of Income Tax (Investigation),New Delhi and Another v\tPrecedent\nPooran Mal & Sons and Another [(1975) 4 SCC 568 1974 Indlaw SC 354] the issue was regarding waiver of benefits under a statute of limitation\tPrecedent\nIt was stated: \"We may in this connection refer to the decision in Wilson v\tPrecedent\nMcIntosh\tPrecedent\nIn that case an applicant to bring lands under the Real Property Act filed his case in court under Section 21,more than three months after a caveat had been lodged,and thereafter obtained an order that the caveator should file her case,which she accordingly did\tPrecedent\nIt was held that he had thereby waived his right to have the caveat set aside as lapsed u/s.23.The Privy Council held that the limitation of time contained in S.23 was introduced for the benefit of the applicant,to enable him to obtain a speedy determination of his right to have the land brought under the provisions of the Act and that it was competent for the applicant to waive the limit of the three months,and that he did waive it by stating a case and applying for and obtaining an order upon the appellant to state her case both,which steps assumed and proceeded on the assumption of the continued existence of the caveat\tPrecedent\nThey referred with approval to the decision in Phillips v\tPrecedent\nMartin where the Chief Justice said: \"Here there is abundant evidence of waiver,and it is quite clear that a man may by his conduct waive a provision of an Act of Parliament intended for his benefit\tPrecedent\nThe caveator was not brought into Court in any way until the caveat had lapsed\tPrecedent\nAnd now the applicant,after all these proceedings have been taken by him,after doubtless much expense has been incurred on the part of the caveator,and after lying by and hoping to get a judgment of the Court in his favour,asks the Court to do that which but for some reasons known to himself he might have asked the Court to do before any other step in the proceedings had been taken\tPrecedent\nI think he is altogether too late\tPrecedent\nIt is to my mind a clear principle of equity,and I have no doubt there are abundant authorities on the point,that equity will interfere to prevent the machinery of an Act of Parliament being used by a person to defeat equities which he has himself raised,and to get rid of a waiver created by his own acts\tPrecedent\nThe legal principle emerging from these decisions is also stated in Craies on Statute Law (6th Edn.) at page 369 as follows: \"As a general rule,the conditions imposed by statutes which authorise legal proceedings are treated as being indispensable to giving the court jurisdiction\tRatio of the decision\nBut if it appears that the statutory conditions were inserted by the legislature simply for the security or benefit of the parties to the Action themselves,and that no public interests are involved,such conditions will not be considered as indispensable,and either party may waive them without affecting the jurisdiction of the court\tRatio of the decision\nemphasis supplied\tRatio of the decision\nApplying the above principles to the present case,it must be held that the benefit of notice provided under the Act and Rules being for the benefit of the Appellant in which no public interests are involved,he has waived the same\tRatio of the decision\nSignificantly,a similar conclusion was reached in the case of Krishna Bahadur v\tPrecedent\nPurna Theatre [(2004) 8 SCC 229 2004\tPrecedent\nIndlaw SC 681],though the principle was stated far more precisely,in the following terms: \"The principle of waiver although is akin to the principle of estoppel; the difference between the two,however,is that whereas estoppel is not a cause of action; it is a rule of evidence; waiver is contractual and may constitute a cause of action; it is an agreement between the parties and a party fully knowing of its rights has agreed not to assert a right for a consideration\tPrecedent\nA right can be waived by the party for whose benefit certain requirements or conditions had been provided for by a statute subject to the condition that no public interest is involved therein\tPrecedent\nWhenever waiver is pleaded it is for the party pleading the same to show that an agreement waiving the right in consideration of some compromise came into being\tPrecedent\nStatutory right,however,may also be waived by his conduct\tPrecedent\nEmphasis supplied] [See also Bank of India v\tPrecedent\nO.P.Swarnakar (2003) 2 SCC 721 2002 Indlaw SC 1562\tPrecedent\nIn Ramdev Food Products Pvt\tPrecedent\nLtd.v\tPrecedent\nArvindbhai Rambhai Patel and Ors.[2006 (8) SCALE 631 2006 Indlaw SC 786],this Court observed: \"The matter may be considered from another angle\tPrecedent\nIf the first respondent has expressly waived his right on the trade mark registered in the name of the appellant-Company,could he claim the said right indirectly\tPrecedent\nThe answer to the said question must be rendered in the negative\tPrecedent\nIt is well-settled that what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly\tPrecedent\nThe term 'Waiver' has been described in the following words: \"Waiver is the abandonment of a right in such a way that the other party is entitled to plead the abandonment by way of confession and avoidance if the right is thereafter asserted,and is either express or implied from conduct\tPrecedent\nA person who is entitled to rely on a stipulation,existing for his benefit alone,in a contract or of a statutory provision may waive it,and allow the contract or transaction to proceed as though the stipulation or provision did not exist\tPrecedent\nWaiver of this kind depends upon consent,and the fact that the other party has acted upon it is sufficient consideration It seems that,in general,where one party has,by his words or conduct,made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly,then,once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it,so as to alter his position,the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him,but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he has himself so introduced,even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration.[See 16 Halsbury's Laws (4th edn) para 1471\tPrecedent\nIn this view of the matter,it may safely be stated that the appellant,through his conduct,has waived his right to an equitable remedy in the instant case\tRatio of the decision\nSuch conduct precludes and operates as estoppel against him with respect to asserting a right over a portion of the acquired land in a situation where the scheme in question has attained finality following as a result of the appellant's inaction\tRatio of the decision\nLalit submits that his client is ready and willing to pay some reasonable amount to the respondent No.3 in whose favour plot No.165 has been finally allotted\tRatio of the decision\nIssuance of any such direction,in our opinion,is legally impermissible\tRatio of the decision\nWe,therefore,are of the opinion that in this case,no relief can be granted to the appellant\tRuling by Present Court\nHe may,however,take recourse to such remedy which is available with him in law including one by filing a suit or making a representation before the State\tRuling by Present Court\nFor the reasons aforementioned,the appeal is dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nNo costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

allowed the appeal filed by the appellants thereby confirming the conviction of the appellants with certain modifications\tFacts\nBriefly stated, case of the prosecution is that on the fateful day i.e. 18.11.1994, at about 8.00 A.M. in the morning the complainant Jagdish (PW-5) along with his two sons namely Sukhbir and Mange Ram (PW-6) were busy in cutting pullas (reeds) from the dola of their

region with mass effect and Sukhbir needed urgent surgery and he was operated upon and the large extra-dural haematoma was removed\tFacts\nDr. Pardeep Kumar (PW-2) also examined the other injured persons, PW 5-Jagdish and PW\tFacts\n6- Mange Ram\tFacts\nStatement of Jagdish was recorded, based on which F.I.R. was registered at Police Station Taoru, Gurgaon under Sections 323, 324, 325 and 307 read with S. 34 IPC\tFacts\nPW 8-Ramesh Kumar (ASI) had taken up the investigation\tFacts\nHe examined the witnesses and after completion of investigation, challan was filed under Sections 307, 325,

by Lower Court\nMs. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the evidence of the witnesses suffers from material discrepancy and is self- contradictory\tArgument\nIt was submitted that injured witness Sukhbir was not examined in the court and neither CT Scan nor x-ray nor operational notes of Sukhbir were produced before the court and in the absence of such material evidence, courts below erred in convicting the second accused u/s\tArgument\n307 IPC\tRatio of the decision\nAdditionally, the learned counsel contended that the defence plea of private defence was not considered by the courts below in proper perspective\tArgument\nPer contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-State contended that the evidence of all the witnesses satisfactorily establishes the overt act of the accused persons and Jagdish (PW-5) and Mange Ram (PW-6) being the injured witnesses, the veracity of these witnesses cannot be doubted\tArgument\nIt was submitted that the medical evidence sufficiently corroborated the oral evidence and the prosecution has established the intention of the 2nd accused in causing attempt to commit murder of Sukhbir and in appreciation of the evidence, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the second accused u/s\tArgument\n307 IPC and the same warrants no interference\tArgument\nWe have carefully considered the rival contentions and gone through the impugned judgment and perused the materials on record\tRatio of the decision\nAs it emerges from the evidence, complainant Jagdish (PW-5) and his two sons Sukhbir and Mange Ram were cutting pullas\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused party went there and asked them not to cut the pullas\tRatio of the decision\nIn the wordy altercation, second accused Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju gave pharsi blows on the head of Sukhbir\tRatio of the decision\nPWs 5 & 6 have clearly spoken about the overt act of the accused that A-1 Jage Ram attacked and caused injury to PW-5 Jagdish with jaily blows and that second accused Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju attacked on the head of Sukhbir with pharsi\tRatio of the decision\nThey have also stated that Madan and Rakesh caused injuries to PW5-Jagdish with lathi on shoulder and left elbow respectively\tRatio of the decision\nPW\tRatio of the decision\n2- Dr. Pardeep Kumar in his evidence stated that he has examined PWs 5 and 6 and noted the injuries on the body of PWs 5 and 6 and issued wound certificates\tRatio of the decision\nEvidence of PWs 5 and 6 is amply corroborated by medical evidence\tRatio of the decision\nPWs 5 and 6 being injured witnesses, their evidence is entitled to great weight\tRatio of the decision\nCogent and convincing grounds are required to discard the evidence of injured witnesses\tRatio of the decision\nIn the light of the fact that PWs 5 and 6 were injured witnesses, courts below tested their evidence for its credibility and recorded concurrent findings that PWs 5 and 6 are trustworthy witnesses\tRatio of the decision\nWe find no reason to take a different view\tRatio of the decision\nAppellants have raised the contention that the prosecution failed to adduce evidence that A-2 Rajbir attempted to commit murder of Sukhbir\tArgument\nIt was submitted that injured person Sukhbir was neither examined nor medical evidence like CT Scan, x-ray and operational notes and Sukhbir were produced to corroborate the oral evidence and while so courts below erred in convicting second accused Rajbir\tArgument\nDr. Pardeep Kumar-PW-2, who examined Sukhbir found during his medico-legal examination a lacerated wound in the middle of the top of the skull\tFacts\nInjured-Sukhkbir was found vomiting in the hospital and he was examined by a Neuro Surgeon Dr. Hilol Kanti Pal (PW-9) of Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi on 19.11.1994, i.e. the day after the incident\tFacts\nPW-9 has stated that Sukhbir was unconscious since 2.00 P.M. on 18.11.1994 and was deeply comatose with irregularity of pupils and a laceration was diagnosed on the right front parietal region\tFacts\nFurther, PW-9 has stated that during the CT scan, it was revealed that a large extra-dural haemotoma was present in the frontal region with mass effect and to avoid further deterioration of his condition, he was operated upon by frontal trephine craniopmy an haemotoma measuring about 125 ml was evacuated\tFacts\nPW-9\tFacts\nstated that had not the operation been conducted on Sukhbir and had not the extra-dural haemotoma removed by operation urgently, the head injury caused to Sukhbir would have caused his death\tFacts\nAs noted by the High Court, it is thus brought on evidence that had not surgical assistance been given to Sukhbir, he would have definitely died\tFacts\nFor the purpose of conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC, prosecution has to establish (i) the intention to commit murder and (ii) the act done by the accused\tRatio of the decision\nThe burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the accused person intended to commit murder of another person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case\tRatio of the decision\nTo justify a conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC, it is not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nThe intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of State of M.P. vs. Kashiram & Ors\tPrecedent\nAIR 2009\tPrecedent\nSC 1642\tPrecedent\n2009) 4 SCC 26 2009 Indlaw SC 92, the scope of intention for attracting conviction u/s\tPrecedent\n307 IPC was elaborated and it was held as under\tPrecedent\nIt is sufficient to justify a conviction u/s\tPrecedent\n307 if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof\tPrecedent\nIt is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted\tPrecedent\nThe section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any\tPrecedent\nThe court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section\tPrecedent\nTherefore, an accused charged u/s\tPrecedent\n307 IPC cannot be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt\tPrecedent\nThis position was highlighted in State of Maharashtra v. Balram Bama Patil, (1983) 2 SCC 28 1983 Indlaw SC 414, Girija Shanker v. State of U.P.(2004) 3 SCC 793 2004 Indlaw SC 78 and R. Prakash v. State of Karnataka (2004) 9 SCC 27 2004 Indlaw SC 117\tPrecedent\nWhether there was intention to kill or knowledge that death will be caused is a question of fact and would depend on the facts of a given case\tPrecedent\nThe circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of S. 307 IPC\tPrecedent\nThe determinative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and not the nature of the injury\tPrecedent\nState of M.P. v. Saleem (2005) 5 SCC 554 2005 Indlaw SC 413 Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats\tPrecedent\nIt is, therefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed, etc\tPrecedent\nThis position was illuminatingly stated by this Court in Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N.(1991) 3 SCC 471 1991 Indlaw SC 683\tPrecedent\nHaving regard to the weapon used for causing the head injuries to Sukhbir, nature of injures, situs of the injury and the severity of the blows, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the 2nd appellant u/s\tRatio of the decision\nIn our considered view, the conviction of the second appellant Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC is unassailable\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel for the appellants contended that the second appellant is in custody for more than three years and since the occurrence was in the year 1994, prayed for reduction of the sentence imposed on the second appellant to the period already undergone\tArgument\nPlacing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Hari Singh vs. Sukhbir Singh & Ors (1988) 4 SCC 551 1988 Indlaw SC 27., learned counsel for the appellants additionally submitted that in terms of S. 357 (3) Cr\tArgument\nP.C. that the compensation may be awarded to the victim and the sentence be modified to the period already undergone\tArgument\nFor the conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC, courts below imposed upon the 2nd appellant rigorous imprisonment of five years, while imposing punishment, courts have an obligation to award appropriate punishment\tRatio of the decision\nQuestion of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and the same has to be exercised by the courts taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nWhat sentence would meet the ends of justice would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the courts must keep in mind the gravity of the offence, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances\tPrecedent\nVide State of M.P. vs. Bablu Natt (2009) 2 SCC 272 2008 Indlaw SC 2027; Alister Anthony Pareira vs. State of Maharashtra (2012) 2 SCC 648 2012 Indlaw SC 12 and Soman vs. State of Kerala (2013) 11 SCC 382 2012 Indlaw SC\tPrecedent\nIn the light of the above, considering the case in hand, the occurrence was of the year 1994 when the complainant party was cutting pullas, the accused asked them not to cut the pullas which resulted in the wordy altercation\tRatio of the decision\nIn the heat of passion, the accused have caused injuries to the complainant party\tRatio of the decision\nThe second accused Rajbir\tRuling by Present Court\nRaju is in custody\tRatio of the decision\nHe surrendered on 5.1.2012 and is stated to be in custody since then, for more than three years\tRatio of the decision\nHaving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, in our considered view, the period of sentence of five years may be reduced to three years apart from directing the second appellant Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju to pay substantial compensation to injured-Sukhbir\tRatio of the decision\nAs noticed above, injured-Sukhbir sustained grievous head injuries and was deeply comatose and was in a state of shock and trauma\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel for the injured-witness submitted that for quite some time injured-Sukhbir was unconscious and thereafter suffering from mental trauma\tArgument\nHaving regard to the nature of injuries sustained by Sukhbir and the period of treatment and other circumstances, we are of the view that, it would be appropriate to direct second appellant- accused Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju to pay Rs.7,50,000/- as compensation to the injured-Sukhbir\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the matter came up for hearing on 14.10.2014, learned counsel for the appellants informed the Court that he had offered Rs.5,00,000/- by way of demand draft towards compensation to the injured-Sukhbir in the presence of the Sarpanch of the village which he has refused to receive the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe said amount of Rs.5,00,000/- is now kept in fixed deposit in the Registry of this Court\tRatio of the decision\nFor inflicting blows on PW-5 Jagidsh with jaily A-1 Jage Ram was convicted u/s\tRuling by Lower Court\n325 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year.

collected\tFacts\nThe blood stained clothes of the deceased and the injured persons as also the swords were sent to the chemical examiner for analysis\tFacts\nAfter completion of the investigation,two charge-sheets arising out of crime No.101/90 and crime No.102/90 were filed before the Designated Court\tFacts\nDuring the pendency of the two charge-sheets the Addl\tFacts\nPublic Prosecutor through an application,Ex\tFacts\nP-35,requested the Court for holding trial in respect of both the chargesheets together,which application was allowed by the Designated Court vide order dated 5 December 1992 and that is how both the cases were tried together by virtue of the provisions of Section 220 (1) Cr\tFacts\nP.C.,as the series of acts in both the cases were so inter-connected as to form one transaction\tFacts\nAt the trial,the prosecution alleged that the accused party with an intent to commit terror in the Wadar community had committed the murder of Popat and injured PW-9 and PW-14,by using lethal weapons and had thereby committed terror in the Wadar community and,thus,committed an offence under Section 3 of TADA,besides the other offences as already noticed\tArgument\nBaloba (A-1) died during the pendency of the trial and therefore,the proceedings against him abated\tArgument\nThe plea of the remaining accused in their statements under Section 313 Cr\tArgument\nP.C.was one of total denial and false implication\tArgument\nAccording to A-2,A-3,A-5,A-6 and A-7 they had been identified by PW-9,during the identification parade,at the instance of the police.A-4 alleged false implication at the instance of PW-15 Waman while A-8 alleged false implication at the hands of the police with a view to pressurise him to withdraw a complaint concerning the murder of his brother and 5 others allegedly committed by the police.A-9 also put forward a similar defence,while A-10 alleged that the police had instituted a false case against him at the instance of Narayan Dhotare,according to A-11,also the witnesses had deposed falsely against him at the instance of Narayan Dhotare\tArgument\nThe learned Judge of the Designated Court acquitted A-2,A-3,A-4,A-6,A-7 and A-12 of the offences charged against them,apparently influenced by the lack of identification of these accused persons by the prosecution witnesses at the identification parade conducted by the Executive Magistrate\tFacts\nThe appellants,however,were convicted and sentenced in the manner as already noticed\tFacts\nWe have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record\tFacts\nThat the incident arose out of a petty altercation between A-11 and his three companions with PW-10 and his three companions at the video parlour and later on led in the homicidal death of Popat Band Patte on 11 August 1990 and injuries to PW9 and PW14 was neither disputed before the learned Designated Court nor before us\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the post-mortem report prepared by Dr\tRatio of the decision\nA.P.Khiste\tRatio of the decision\nPW-22),we find that the deceased had four incised injuries which had caused extensive damage to his internal organs also\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to PW-22,the internal injuries on the deceased were a result of the following external injuries: (1) Incised wound,transverse on left groin at centre medial to left public symphysis and left superior iliac crest,all muscles,vessels cut,both femoral vessels,vein artery cut,dimension 4 x 2 x 5 cms\tRatio of the decision\nTransverse incised wound on right parital region,bone deep,4 x 2 x 1 cms.,6\tRatio of the decision\ncms.above right ear,fracture of right parietal bone with laceration of brain\tRatio of the decision\n3) Verticle incised wound 5 x 1 x 1 cms.,bone deep at centre of vertex,fracture of skull with laceration of brain\tRatio of the decision\nPW 22 opined that these injuries,individually as well as collectively,were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\tRatio of the decision\nPW-9 was examined by Dr\tFacts\nKhiste PW-22 who noticed the following two injuries on his person: (1) Transverse superficial incised wound 10x1/2 cm.on posterior of left knee in popliteal\tFacts\nEdges were clean out\tFacts\n2) Abraded contusion below right knee and front of right leg,5 x 5 cm\tFacts\nPW-14 Bajrang was also medically examined and the following injuries were found on him :- (1\tFacts\nTransverse Lacerated would on occipital region,3 x 1 cm.,bone deep\tFacts\nInjury was bleeding fresh\tFacts\n2) Multiple abraded contusion all over the back\tFacts\nThe defence plea of total denial and false implication has been rightly rejected by the Designated Court in view of the over-whelming,cogent and reliable prosecution evidence\tFacts\nThe trial court for the purposes of consideration of the evidence divided the prosecution case into three parts namely; (i) the incident at Vrindavan video parlour (ii) incident near Jagdamba hotel and (iii) the incident at the Math\tFacts\nSo far as the first incident is concerned,that merely provided the motive for the assault near the Jagdamba hotel and the Math\tFacts\nThe evidence regarding the first incident was given by PW10,PW11 and PW12.These witnesses deposed that while they were watching a movie at the video parlour,A-11,A-6 and A-10 alongwith one other person had occupied the seats in the row behind them and when the leg of A-11 dashed against the leg of PW10,who told him to keep his leg properly,A-11 started abusing him in filthy language and threatened him that he would \"deal\" with him\tFacts\nIn view of the altercation,the complainants left the video parlour and went towards Jagdamba hotel\tFacts\nSome of the prosecution witnesses including the deceased,PW9 and PW14 were already standing near the Jagdamba hotel\tFacts\nPW10 narrated the incident of the video parlour to those persons and in the meantime the accused party arrived there in a jeep and two auto-rickshaws and started assaulting the complainant party\tFacts\nHowever,according to the prosecution evidence itself,during the assault,none out of the four prosecution witnesses with whom the altercation had taken place at the video parlour was injured\tFacts\nNear the Jagdamba Hotel it was Bajrang PW-14 who received the injuries at the hands of the accused\tFacts\nSome of the other witnesses including Popat deceased and Baban PW-9 fled towards the Math to save themselves\tFacts\nThe evidence of PW10,PW-11 and PW-12 has received ample corroboration from the testimony of PW-9,PW-13,PW-14 and PW-15,who deposed that while the witnesses were narrating the incident of the video parlour to Waman Band Patte PW-15 and other witnesses present there the accused party arrived in a Jeep and two auto-rickshaws variously armed and opened an attack on the complainant party with a view to teach them a lesson for the altercation which had taken place earlier at the video parlour\tFacts\nWe do not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that since Mohan Lal PW-19,who runs the video parlour has not fully supported the prosecution version regarding the cause of altercation at the video parlour,the genesis of the occurrence gets shrouded in doubt\tRatio of the decision\nPW-19 was declared hostile by the prosecution and was cross examined by the Addl\tRatio of the decision\nPublic Prosecutor\tRatio of the decision\nWe find from a careful analysis of the evidence that the testimony of PW9 to PW-15 regarding the incident at the video parlour is cogent and trustworthy and nothing has been brought out during the cross-examination of these witnesses which may cast any doubt about the correctness of the version given by them regarding the incident at the video parlour\tRatio of the decision\nEven from the evidence of the hostile witness PW-19 Mohanlal,it emerges that on the day of the incident there was an altercation at the video parlour,though he has given the cause of the altercation to be somewhat different,which explanation does not appeal to us\tRatio of the decision\nEven if for the sake of argument we were to ignore the evidence of PW19,it would not materially affect the prosecution case in so faras the incident at the video parlour is concerned\tRatio of the decision\nWe are in agreement with the Designated Court that there is ample evidence led by the prosecution to establish the incident at the video parlour and also that the said incident was the origin for the subsequent assault\tRatio of the decision\nTo connect the accused with the incidents near the Jagdamba hotel and the Math,the prosecution has examined PW3,PW4,PW9,PW10,PW11,PW12,PW13 and PW14 besides PW7,PW20 and PW21.The last three witnesses,however,turned hostile at the trial and were cross-examined by the Addl\tFacts\nPublic Prosecutor with the permission of the court\tFacts\nOut of the remaining witnesses mentioned above,PW-9\tFacts\nand PW-14 are the injured witnesses\tFacts\nThese are thus the stamped witnesses whose presence admits of no doubt and being themselves the victims they would not leave out the real assailants and substitute them with innocent persons\tFacts\nPW-15 Waman Band Patte who is the owner of the Jagdamba hotel has lent sufficient corroboration to the testimony of the other prosecution witnesses in general and PW9 and PW14 in particular\tFacts\nFrom the testimony of PW9,it stands established that while Mukesh PW-12 was narrating the incident which had taken place at the video parlour,the appellants alongwith 7/8 other persons arrived in a jeep and two auto-rickshaws armed with swords,satturs and sticks and opened the assault on the prosecution witnesses and that A-11 and his two associates assaulted PW-14 with swords\tFacts\nHis testimony receives ample corroboration from the testimony of PW10,PW11,PW14 and PW15 Waman,the proprietor of Jagdamba Hotel besides the medical evidence\tRatio of the decision\nThese witnesses categorically deposed that A-5,A-10 and A-11 were responsible for causing injuries to Bajrang PW-14\tRatio of the decision\nThese witnesses knew the accused from before by their names and had also identified them later when called upon to do so\tFacts\nThey specifically described the roles played by A-5,A-10 and A-11.PW-10,PW-11,PW-12,PW-13,PW-14 and PW-15 also spoke about the presence of A-1,A-8 and A-9 with their respective weapons alongwith A-5,A-10 and A-11 near the Jagdamba Hotel at the time of assault on PW-14\tFacts\nAn identification parade had been held by Shri Shrikant Chimanaji Jahagirdar (PW-32),Executive Magistrate\tFacts\nAt the identification parade,A-5 was identified by PW-9,PW10,PW-11,PW-14 and PW-15; A-10 by PWs 10 to 15; A-11 by PW 3 and PWs 9 to 15; A-1 by PWs 10 to 15; A-8 and A-9 by PW-3 and by PWs 10 to 15\tFacts\nSo far as other accused are concerned,none of the prosecution witnesses ascribed any role to A-2,A-3 and A-12 and even though PW-15 deposed at the trial about the presence of A-4,A-6 and A-7 and stated that they were present with the accused party but the trial court,for good and sufficient reasons found that his testimony as regards their presence in the unlawful assembly,had not received trustworthy corroboration from any other prosecution evidence\tFacts\nThe learned Designated Court opined that though the identity of A-1 (since dead),A-5,A-8,A-9,A-10 and A-11 as the assailants had been established by the prosecution evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,the same could not be said about the participation of the remaining accused\tFacts\nWe agree\tRatio of the decision\nFrom our independent analytical appreciation of the evidence on the record,we are of the opinion that the Designated Court rightly found the participation of A-1,A-5,A-8,A-9 and A-11,in the assault,to have been positively established\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,so far as A-10 is concerned,we find that there is merit in the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant that his identify and participation in the assault has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt\tRatio of the decision\nBaban Karpe PW-9,himself an injured witness,failed to identify A-10 at the time of the identification parade held by PW-32,though he identified A-10 later on in the Court during the trial\tRatio of the decision\nThat apart the name of A-10 does not figure specifically in the statement of Baban PW-9,which formed the basis of the FIR,Ex.77.PW-10,PW-11 and PW-15 have tried to implicate A-10 by making tell tale improvements in their statements at the trial by ascribing a role to him in the assault by improving upon their statements earlier recorded during the investigation,with which statements they were duly confronted\tRatio of the decision\nEven Bajrang PW-14 who is an injured witness himself and deposed about the incident at Jagdamba hotel with sufficient details appears to have exaggerated the version when he stated that he had been assaulted by A-10 also besides A-5 and A-11 auite contrary to his earlier statement\tRatio of the decision\nThere is only one injury which was received by PW-14 and according to the other prosecution witnesses,that injury had been caused to him by A-11.The tendency to exaggerate the incident is not uncommon and that an innocent person may be roped in alongwith the guilty ones is a possibility which cannot,in the facts and circumstances of this case,be ruled out\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of the improvement made by the prosecution witnesses at the trial from their earlier statements and the infirmities already noticed,we are of the opinion that it cannot be said with any amount of certainty that the participation of A-10 in the assault or even his presence in the unlawful assembly at the time of the assault near Jagdamba hotel or the Math,has been substantiated\tRatio of the decision\nThe prosecution has not been able to establish the case against A-10 beyond a reasonable doubt and is our opinion he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt\tRatio of the decision\nIn so far as the remaining appellants are concerned,the evidence of the eye-witnesses and particularly of PW-3 and PWs 9 to 14 unmistakably connects them with the assault on the complainant party near the Jagdamba hotel and at the Math,resulting in the death of Popat and injuries being caused to PW9 and PW14.Despite searching cross-examination,nothing has been brought out in their cross-examination from which any doubt may arise about the participation of A-1,A-5,A-8,A-9 and A-11 in the assault or discredit the testimony of any of these witnesses\tRatio of the decision\nTheir evidence establishes the manner in which the assault originated as well as the role played by each one of them\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellants (other than A10) were as already noticed identified by various prosecution witnesses at the identification parade held by PW-32,the Executive Magistrate also\tRatio of the decision\nBesides,the testimony of these prosecution witnesses has received ample corroboration from the medical evidence as well as the recoveries of the weapons of offence\tRatio of the decision\nFrom our independent examination of the material on the record,we are satisfied that the prosecution has been able to establish its case against A-5,A-8,A-9 and A-11 and the deceased A-1 beyond a reasonable doubt\tRatio of the decision\nThat takes us now to consider the nature of the offence committed by A-5,A-8,A-9 and A-11\tRatio of the decision\nThe Designated Court,as already noticed,found all of them guilty and convicted them for the offences under Section 3 TADA,302/149,307/149 and 323/149 IPC\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe victims,it appears from the record,belong to the Wadar community\tFacts\nThe Designated Court after considering the evidence of the first incident and the manner of assault on the deceased and PW-9 and PW-14,came to the conclusion that the appellants,alongwith some others had intended to create terror in a section of the people (Wadar community) and with that intention had assaulted PW-14,the deceased and PW9 by lethal weapons and were therefore guilty of committing an offence under Section 3 TADA\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn our opinion the Designated Court fell in error in holding that an offence under Section 3 of TADA had been committed by the accused-appellants in the established facts and circumstances of this case\tRatio of the decision\nMerely because the deceased and the two injured witnesses belong to Wadar community,no inference could be drawn that the attack by the appellants on them was intended to strike terror in a section of the society,namely,the Wadar community\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no basis for such an assumption\tRatio of the decision\nProsecution has led no evidence in that behalf either\tRatio of the decision\nIt appears to be a mere coincidence that PW9,PW14 and the deceased all belong to the \"Wadar Community\".There is nothing on the record to disclose as to which community do the appellants belong to or what grievance they had against the \"Wadar Community\".By no stretch of imagination\tRatio of the decision\ncan it be said that the accused had the intention to strike terror,much less in a particular section of the society,when they entered into an altercation at the video parlour or even when they went after the complainant party and opened an assault on then opposite Jagdamba hotel or at the Math\tRatio of the decision\nNone out of those who were present at the video parlour received any injury and there is no material on the record to show as to which community did they belong to either\tRatio of the decision\nProsecution has led no evidence nor brought any circumstances on the record from which any inference may be drawn that the appellants intended to strike terror amongst the \"Wadar Community\".It was not proper for the Designated Court to draw an inference of intention from the mere consequence,i.e.,the victims belonging to the particular community\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned trial court appears to have ignored to take into consideration the essential requirements for establishing an offence under Section 3 of TADA\tRatio of the decision\nIn Hitendra Vishnu Thakur And Others Vs\tPrecedent\nState of Maharashtra\tPrecedent\nAnd Others [(1994) 4 SCC,602\tPrecedent\n1994 Indlaw SC 1706 this Court opined that the criminal activity in order to invoke TADA must be committed with the requisite intention as contemplated by Section 3(1) of the Act by use of such weapons as have been enumerated therein and which cause or are likely to result in the commission of offences as mentioned in that Section\tPrecedent\nIt was observed : \"Thus,keeping in view the settled position that the provisions of Section 3 of TADA have been held to be Constitutionally valid in Kartar Singh case and from the law laid down by this Court in Usmanbhai and Niranjan cases,it follows that an activity which is sought to be punished under Section 3(1) of TADA has to be such which cannot be classified as a mere law and order problem or disturbance of public order or even disturbance of the even tempo of the life of the community of any specified locality but is of the nature which cannot be tackled as an ordinary criminal activity under the ordinary penal law by the normal law-enforcement agencies because the intended extent and reach of the criminal activity of the 'terrorist' is such which travels beyond the gravity of the mere disturbance of public order even of a 'virulent nature' and may at times transcend the frontiers of the locality and may include such anti-national activities which throw a challenge to the very integrity and sovereignty of the country in its democratic polity\tPrecedent\nThus,unless the Act complained of falls strictly within the letter and spirit of Section 3(1) of TADA and is committed with the intention as envisaged by that section by means of the weapons etc.as are enumerated therein with the motive as postulated thereby,an accused cannot be tried or convicted for an offence under Section 3(1) of TADA\tPrecedent\nLikewise,if it is only as a consequence of the criminal act that fear,terror or/and panic is caused but the intention of committing the particular crime cannot be said to be the one strictly envisaged by Section 3(1),it would be impermissible to try or convict and punish an accused under TADA.The commission of the crime with the intention to achieve the result as envisaged by the section and not merely where the consequence of the crime committed by the accused create that result,would attract the provisions of Section 3(1) of TADA\tPrecedent\nEmphasis supplied\tRuling by Lower Court\nThus,keeping in view the background in which the occurrence took place,namely,the altercation at the video parlour,which has a great relevance to determine the applicability of Section 3 TADA,we are of the opinion that the finding of the Designated Court that the appellants have committed an offence punishable under Section 3 TADA is clearly erroneous\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn fairness to the learned counsel for the State Mr\tRuling by Lower Court\nMadhav Reddy,Sr.advocate,we must also record that he conceded that in the facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in view the law laid down by the Constitution Bench in Kartar Singh's case [1994\tRuling by Lower Court\nsupp) Scale 1 1994 Indlaw SC 525 ] and Hitendra Vishnu Thakur's case 1994 Indlaw SC 1706 (supra) no offence under Section 3 of TADA could be said to have been committed by the appellants\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe conviction and sentence of the appellants for the offence under Section 3 TADA cannot therefore,be sustained and is hereby set aside\tRuling by Lower Court\nAppellants No.1 (A-5),2 (A-8),3 (A-9) and\tRatio of the decision\n5 (A-11) had alongwith the deceased accused A-1 and some others,about whose identity there has been some doubt,formed an unlawful assembly and in furtherance of the common object of that assembly committed the murder of Popat deceased besides causing injuries to PW9 and PW14\tRatio of the decision\nThe Designated Court therefore,rightly found the said appellants guilty of the offences under Section 302/149,307/149 and Section 324/149\tStatute\nIPC.The conviction and sentence of appellants No.1 (A-5),2 (A-8),3 (A-9) and 5 (A-11) for the said offences,as recorded by the learned Designated Court,are well merited,and calls for no interference\tStatute\nIn the result,the appeal succeeds insofar as A-10 (appellant No.4) is concerned\tRatio of the decision\nHe is given the benefit of doubt and acquitted of all the charges against him\tRatio of the decision\nHe shall be released from custody forthwith if not required in any other case\tRatio of the decision\nThe conviction and sentence of appellants No.1,2,3 and 5 for the offence under Section 3 TADA is also set aside but their conviction and sentence for the other offences as recorded by the Designated Court is upheld and to that extent their appeals fail\tRatio of the decision\nBefore we part with the judgment,we would also like to deal with a submission made on behalf of the appellants by their learned counsel that since the offence under Section 3 of TADA is not made out,the criminal appeal filed in this court,may be transferred to the High Court for its disposal in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,for the reason that a first appeal against conviction and sentence recorded for various offences under the Indian Penal Code by the Sessions Court lies to the High Court\tArgument\nLearned counsel submitted that the appellants should not be denied the opportunity to get the first hearing in the High Court because in the event of their failure in the High Court,they still have a chance to approach this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India\tArgument\nThe argument is fallacious and runs in the teeth of the express provisions of Section 19 of TADA\tStatute\nSection 19 (1) and (2) of TADA read as follows\tStatute\n19.Appeal - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code,an appeal shall lie as a matter of right from any judgment,sentence or order,not being an interlocutory order,of a Designated Court to the Supreme Court both on facts and on law\tStatute\n2) Except as aforesaid,no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any judgment,sentence or order including an interlocutory order of a Designated Court\tStatute\nA bare perusal of the above Section shows that an appeal against the judgment,sentence or order,of the Designated Court (except an interlocutory order) shall lie on facts and on law to the Supreme Court and that no appeal or revision shall lie to any other court\tRatio of the decision\nIn the face of this express provision,there is no scope to urge that the appeal may be transferred to the High Court because of the acquittal of the appellants for the offence punishable under Section 3 TADA by us\tRatio of the decision\nIn a case where the Designated Court finds that no offence under TADA is made out,it is open to the said Court to transfer the case to the regular Criminal Court under Section 18 TADA but once the charge is framed and the case is tried by the Designated Court,an appeal against conviction,sentence or acquittal lies only to the Supreme Court and to no other court\tRatio of the decision\nUnder Section 12 of TADA the Designated Court has the jurisdiction not only to try the cases under TADA but also to try offences under the Indian Penal Code if the offence under TADA is connected with such other offences\tRatio of the decision\nThe amplitude of powers available to this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India is normally speaking not conditioned by any statutory provision but it cannot be lost sight of that this Court exercises jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution with a view to do justice between the parties but not in disregard of the relevant statutory provisions\tRatio of the decision\nThe transfer of the appeal to the High Court,after hearing the appeal on merits and finding that Section 3 of TADA on the basis of the evidence led by the prosecution,was not made out,is neither desirable nor proper nor permissible let alone justified\tRatio of the decision\nThere cannot be piece meal hearing of an appeal on merits -first by this Court to determine if an offence under TADA is made out or not and then by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe submission of the learned counsel is,thus,devoid of merits and is consequently rejected\tRuling by Present Court\n"

for the appellant submitted that the High Court,before extending the benefit of POB Act to the accused did not call for a report from the authorities to check upon the conduct of the accused-respondent as per Section 4(2) of the POB Act and that the appellant-MCD was also not given time to file their counter affidavit on the question of sentence\tArgument\nHe further submitted

submitted that the order of the High Court does not require any reconsideration by this Court and that the High Court while extending the benefit of POB Act had clearly recorded in the order that the counsel for the State of Delhi is not averse to the grant of benefit of probation to the answering respondent and,therefore,the requirement under Section 4(2) of the POB Act has been waived off by the State and that the High Court took into consideration the fact that the answering respondent has faced the agony of trial for over 12 years and has also undergone some period in custody and while maintaining the conviction of the answering respondent,the benefit of probation was extended to him\tArgument\nIt was,therefore,submitted that the High Court passed the said order in the presence of the counsel of all the parties\tArgument\nLearned senior counsel appearing for the second respondent submitted that in S.T.No.202 of 1997,a judgment was given by the Metropolitan Magistrate on 10.9.2002 and the respondent filed an appeal No.374 of 2002 before the Court of Sessions,Patiala House,New Delhi challenging the said order of conviction and in that appeal,the Court of Additional Sessions Judge,Patiala House,suspended the sentence during the pendency of the appeal upon furnishing a personal bond for a sum of Rs.25,000 with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court\tArgument\nIt was,therefore,submitted that the sentence/imprisonment awarded by the Metropolitan Magistrate has been suspended under Section 389 of the Criminal Procedure Code by the Court of Additional Sessions Judge,Delhi in view of the pendency of the appeal against the order of conviction is a continuation of proceedings and therefore,there is no conviction against the answering respondent so long as the same is not decided by the Court of Sessions\tArgument\nIt was also submitted that the requirement of calling of a report from the Probationer Officer under Section 4(2) of the POB Act has been waived off by the counsel for the State of Delhi and that the counsel for the MCD also did not raise any objection before the High Court\tArgument\nIt was further contended that the respondent has not contested the revision in the High Court on merits and confined his submission to the benefit of Section 4 of the POB Act being extended to him\tArgument\nTherefore,there is no occasion for the High Court to go into the issue of extent of constructions being raised by the answering respondent\tArgument\nHe further contended that the trial Court has committed serious error in exercising jurisdiction while not granting the benefit of probation to the answering respondent and the order of the trial Court was,therefore,rightly and justifiable modified by the High Court\tArgument\nConcluding his arguments,he submitted that the respondent has been released after compliance of the order passed by the High Court by furnishing the bone of good conduct and security to the satisfaction of the Additional Court of Metropolitan Magistrate,Delhi and there is no report of any misconduct or breach of the bond of good conduct by the answering respondent since the date of the order of the High Court,therefore,the order of the High Court is not liable to be interfered with\tArgument\nIn the above background,two questions of law arise for consideration by this Court: \"1.Whether the High Court was correct in extending the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act,1958 to the accused respondent without calling for a report from the Authorities relating to the conduct of the respondent as per Section 4 of the Act\tRatio of the decision\n2.Whether\tRatio of the decision\nthe High Court was correct in passing the impugned judgment in view of the fact that the respondent has been convicted in another criminal case No.202 of 1997 by the trial Court,New Delhi\tRatio of the decision\nBefore proceeding further,it would be beneficial to reproduce Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act,1958 which is extracted below for ready reference\tStatute\nPower of court to release certain offenders on probation of good conduct\tStatute\n1.When any person is found guilty of having committed an offence not punishable with death or imprisonment for life and the court by which the person is found guilty is of opinion that,having record to the circumstances of the case including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender,it is expedient to release him on probation of good conduct,then,notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,the court may,instead of sentencing him at once to any punishment direct that he be released on his entering into a bond,with or without sureties,to appear and receive sentence when called upon during such period,not exceeding three years,as the court may direct,and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behaviour: Provided that the court shall no direct such release of an offender unless it is satisfied that the offender or his surety,if any,has a fixed place of abode or regular occupation in the place over which the court exercises jurisdiction or in which the offender is likely to live during the period for which he enters into the bond\tStatute\n2.Before making any order under sub-section\tStatute\n1),the court shall take into consideration the report,if any,of the Probation Officer concerned in relation to the case\tStatute\nIt is the specific case of the appellant herein that the High Court has not afforded to the appellant an opportunity to file counter affidavit\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant would have filed the orders passed by the criminal Courts convicting the respondent herein had an opportunity been given to the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court while passing the impugned order and judgment did not take into consideration that the accused-respondent has been convicted in another Criminal Case No.202 of 1997 by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate,Patiala House,New Delhi\tRatio of the decision\nIn the said case,the accused has been convicted under Sections 332/461 of the DMC Act and sentenced to six months simple imprisonment with fine of Rs.5000.In our view,there was no good reason for letting the respondent off by granting to him the said benefit of POB Act particularly,keeping in view the large scale irregularity and unauthorized constructions carried by the builders in Delhi despite strict direction of the Municipal authorities and despite of the Courts passing various orders from time to time against the unauthorized construction\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court also failed to take into consideration that the respondent has been in jail for three days and had not put in substantial period in custody\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court vide its order impugned in this appeal has observed that there is no allegation that the respondent is a previous convict\tRatio of the decision\nIn fact,as could be seen from the annexures filed along with this appeal,the respondent has been convicted for offence under Sections 332 and 461 of the DMC Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Trial Court heard the respondent on sentence also and passed the following order: \"Convict in person with counsel Heard on sentence\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt is contended that he is first offender\tRuling by Lower Court\nHe is not a previous convict nor habitual offender\tRuling by Lower Court\nHe has faced trail since 1991.He is aged about 57 years\tRuling by Lower Court\nHe is not doing any business due to his bad health\tRuling by Lower Court\nConsidering the above facts and circumstances,and gravity of the nature of the offence i.e.extent of construction raised by the accused for commercial as 11 shops at ground floor and 11 shops at first floor,I am not inclined to release the accused/convict on probation\tRuling by Lower Court\nHence request declined\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn the interest of justice,sentence of six months SI,with fine of Rs.5000 I.D.one month SI is imposed upon the convict for offence u/s 332/461 DMC Act\tRuling by Lower Court\nFine deposited\tRuling by Lower Court\nConvict remained for sentence\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe Additional Sessions Judge,New Delhi also in Civil Appeal No.7 of 2002 (Annexure P-2) dismissed the appeal as there is no infirmity in the order of the trial Court and uphold the conviction order passed by the trial Court on the point of sentence\tFacts\nThe appellate Court held that no interference is required in the order passed by the trial court regarding point of sentence\tFacts\nSince the appellant-MCD was not given any opportunity by the High Court to file conduct report of the respondent,the order impugned in this appeal is liable to be set aside\tRatio of the decision\nThis apart,the respondent did not also disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the High Court that he has also been convicted in another Criminal Case No.202 of 1997 by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate,Patiala House,New Delhi\tRatio of the decision\nThus,the contesting respondent has come to the High Court with unclean hands and withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side\tRatio of the decision\nIn our opinion,he would be guilty of playing fraud on the Court as well as on the opposite party\tRatio of the decision\nA person whose case is based on falsehood can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation\tRatio of the decision\nWe have no hesitation to say that a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to approach the Court and he can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation\tRatio of the decision\nIn the instant case,non-production of the order and even non-mentioning of the conviction and sentence in the criminal Case No.202 of 1997 tantamounts to playing fraud on the Court\tRatio of the decision\nA litigant who approaches the Court is bound to produce all documents which are relevant to the litigation\tRatio of the decision\nIf he withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well on the opposite party\tRatio of the decision\nThe second respondent,in our opinion,was not justified in suppressing the material fact that he was convicted by the Magistrate on an earlier occasion\tRatio of the decision\nSince the second respondent deliberately suppressed the crucial and important fact,we disapprove strongly and particularly,the conduct of the second respondent and by reason of such conduct,the second respondent disentitled himself from getting any relief or assistance from this Court\tRatio of the decision\nWe,however,part with this case with heavy heart expressing our strong disapproval of the conduct and behaviour but direct that the second respondent to pay a sum of Rs.10,000 by way of cost to the appellant herein\tRatio of the decision\nWe have already reproduced Section 4 of the POB Act\tStatute\nIt applied to all kinds of offenders whether under or above 21 years of age\tStatute\nThis section is intended to attempt possible reformation of an offender instead of inflicting on him the normal punishment of his crime\tStatute\nThe only limitation imposed by Section 6 is that in the first instance an offender under twenty one years of age,will not be sentenced to imprisonment\tStatute\nWhile extending benefit of this case,the discretion of the Court has to be exercised having regard to the circumstances in which the crime was committed,the age,character and antecedents of the offender\tRatio of the decision\nSuch exercise of discretion needs a sense of responsibility\tRatio of the decision\nThe offender can only be released on probation of good conduct under this section when the Court forms an opinion,having considered the circumstances of the case,the nature of the offence and the character of the offender,that in a particular case,the offender should be released on probation of good conduct\tRatio of the decision\nThe section itself is clear that before applying the section,the Magistrate should carefully take into consideration the attendant circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nThe second respondent is a previous convict as per the records placed before us\tRatio of the decision\nSuch a previous convict cannot be released in view of Section 4 of the POB Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Court is bound to call for a report as per Section 4 of POB Act but the High Court has failed to do so although the Court is not bound by the report of the Probationer Officer but it must call for such a report before the case comes to its conclusion\tRatio of the decision\nThe word \"shall\" in sub-section (2) of Section 4 is mandatory and the consideration of the report of the Probationer Officer is a condition precedent to the release of the accused as reported in the case of State v\tPrecedent\nNaguesh G.Shet Govenkar and Anr.,AIR (1970\tPrecedent\nGoa 49 1969 Indlaw GOA 8 and a release without such a report\tPrecedent\nwould,therefore,be illegal\tPrecedent\nIn the case of Ram Singh and Ors.v\tPrecedent\nState of Haryana,[1971] 3 SCC 914 1970 Indlaw SC 513,a Bench of two Judges of this Court in paragraph 16 of the judgment observed as under: \"Counsel for the appellants invoked the application of Probation of Offenders Act\tPrecedent\nSections 4 and 6 of the Act indicate the procedure requiring the Court to call for a report from the Probation Officer and consideration of the report and any other information available relating to the character and physical and mental condition of the offender\tPrecedent\nThese facts are of primary importance before the Court can pass an order under the Probation of Offenders Act\tPrecedent\nThis plea cannot be entertained in this Court\tPrecedent\nIn the case of R.Mahalingam v\tPrecedent\nG.Padmavathi and Anr.,(1979) Crl\tPrecedent\nLJ NOC 20 Mad.,the Court observed as under: \"If any report is filed by the probation officer,the Court is bound to consider it\tPrecedent\nObtaining such a report of the probation officer is mandatory since the sub-s.(1) of S.4 says that the Court shall consider the report of the probation officer\tPrecedent\nWords\tPrecedent\nif any\" do not mean that the Court need not call for a report from the probation officer\tPrecedent\nThe words \"if any\" would only cover a case where notwithstanding such requisition,the probation officer for one reason or other has not submitted a report\tPrecedent\nBefore deciding to act under S.4 (1),it is mandatory on the part of the Court to call for a report from the probation officer and if such a report is received,it is mandatory on the part of the Court to consider the report\tPrecedent\nBut if for one reason or the other such a report is not forthcoming,the Court has to decide the matter on other materials available to it\tPrecedent\nIn the instant case,the Magistrate passed order releasing the accused on probation without taking into consideration their character\tPrecedent\nHeld,the requirement of S.4(1) was not fulfilled and therefore the case remanded\tPrecedent\nSince the High Court has disposed of the criminal revision without giving an opportunity of filing counter affidavit to the counsel for the MCD and that the respondent did not disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the High Court that he has also been convicted in another criminal case No.202 of 1997,the judgment impugned in this appeal cannot be allowed to stand\tRatio of the decision\nWe,therefore,have no hesitation in setting aside the order impugned and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh disposal strictly in accordance with law\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal is,accordingly,allowed with costs of Rs.10,000 to be paid by the second respondent to the appellant,as indicated in paragraph supra\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

State of Maharashtra, [1984] 4 SCC 116 1984 Indlaw SC 432, was relied on\tPrecedent\nIn the later case, it was also held that a false explanation or false plea taken by the accused can be used as an additional link in the chain of circumstantial evidence subject to satisfication of three essential conditions, namely (i) various links in the chain of evidence led by the prosecution have been satisfactorily proved, (ii) the said circumstance points to the guilt of the accused with reasonable definiteness, and (iii) the circumstance is in proxim-ity to the time and situation\tPrecedent\ni\tPrecedent\nLast seen together : On the point of last seen together there is solitary testimony of a child witness Shalu, PW7, aged about 4 years on 23.3.1992, the date of her examination in the court\tPrecedent\nOn asking a few questions by way of preliminary examination the learned Trial Judge found that the witness could 'answer some of the questions\tPrecedent\nShe stated that, accompanied by Phukla-another young girl, a cousin of hers, and S the deceased, she had gone to purchase balloon from the shop of Goma\tPrecedent\nWhile returning the accused told S that her feet were mudstained and he would wash her feet and saying so he took S inside his house, leaving behind the two girls, including Shalu PW7, who returned to their houses leaving S behind\tPrecedent\nIt is this testimony which has been relied upon by the Trial Court as also by the High Court as the evidence of 'last seen together\tRatio of the decision\nThe witness is a child witness of very tender age and examined in the Court almost a year after the date of the incident\tRatio of the decision\nWe have very carefully read the statement of this witness\tRatio of the decision\nThere is nothing in her statement to suggest that what she is narrating in the court is the story of a day soon before the date and time of the incident or the date on which dead body of S was found\tRatio of the decision\nTo constitute evidence of last seen together, the evidence must definitely permit an inference being drawn that the victim and the accused were seen together at a point of time in close proximity with the time and date of the commission of crime\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the evi-dence of Shalu, PW7 such an inference cannot be drawn\tRatio of the decision\nGoma, to whose shop the three girls had gone to buy balloon, has not been examined\tRatio of the decision\nThere is something mysterious about the discovery of Shalu as a witness to the incident\tRatio of the decision\nS has died\tRatio of the decision\nThe third girl who was with S and Shalu has not been examined either in the Court or during investigation\tRatio of the decision\nThe statement of Shahu was recorded during investigation on 25.3.1991, i.e. about six days after the date of incident\tRatio of the decision\nHarish Chand Sharma, the Investigating Officer, was specifically asked how the name of this witness came to his knowledge during investigation\tRatio of the decision\nHe gave an evasive answer saying that the fact that Shalu was accompanying S 'must have come in the staement of the witnesses\tRatio of the decision\nHe was further asked to name the witness in whose statement Shalu's reference was available but the investigation officer drew a blank and could not tell the name of the witness from whom any clue as to Shalu was received by him\tRatio of the decision\nThus how and in what manner the investigating officer came to learn about Shalu, PW7 so as to record her statement during investigation remains shrounded in mystery\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact remains that the testimony of Shalu, PW 7 aged 4 years, even if taken at its face value, does not constitute such a circumstance as to draw an incriminating inference against the accused and connect him with the crime\tRatio of the decision\nii\tRatio of the decision\nAbnormal conduct of accused Kalu Ram, PW5 stated that two or three days after the date of dead body of S having been found\tRatio of the decision\nhe and Santosh\tRatio of the decision\nPW9 had gone to see a movie in a cinema hall where the accused was employed as a gate-keeper\tRatio of the decision\nThere the accused had enquired from them as to what was the punishment awardable to an offender who was found to have been committed rape on a girl and killed her\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused was told by the witness that the punishment could be 20 or even 40 years of imprisonment or imprisonment for life\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter the wit- nesses went to see movie in the cinema hall\tRatio of the decision\nDuring cross-examination, Kalu Ram stated that the accused was his neighbour, previously known to him\tRatio of the decision\nOn a pertinent question the witness stated that while making such a query there was no change in the facial expression of the accused, that is, he had remained normal\tRatio of the decision\nSantosh, PW9, did not support the version of Kalu Ram and was declared hostile\tRatio of the decision\nWithout going into the question as to whether the statement of Kalu Ram, PW5 is to be believed or not in view of the same having not been supported by Santosh PW9, let us assess the intrinsic value of such testimony as a piece of incriminating evidence\tRatio of the decision\nIt appears that to begin with the death of S was a blind murder and the police was clue-less about the likely offender\tRatio of the decision\nThe police appears to have embarked upon a search akin to a combing operation and in that process several suspected characters were called and interrogated\tRatio of the decision\nHarish Chand Sharma, PW21 stated that between 19th and 25th March, 1991 the accused Subhash was called at the police station several times for making enquiries\tRatio of the decision\nHe did not remember and was therefore not in a position to tell how many number of times the accused Subhash was called for interrogation or making enquiries\tRatio of the decision\nOn seeing the case diary he stated that on 21.3.1991 the accused was definitely called twice on the same day though there is no mention of what enquiries were made from him\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, the accused was not detained and was sent back\tRatio of the decision\nAny person even if innocent and not connected in any way with a gruesome crime which had recently occurred and was talk of the town, if called by police and interrogated as a suspect, would be scared and be apprehensive of the likelihood of his being implicated in the crime\tRatio of the decision\nPlaced in such situation if a villager, unaware of the law, happens to ask a person, who he feels knows the things better than what he himself does, as to what would be the period of incarceration to be suffered by any person for such an offence the impulse for inquiry may be outcome of a feeling of nervousness or mere inquisitiveness; such an enquiry is not necessarily suggestive of the working of a criminal mind\tRatio of the decision\niii) Recovery of underwear stained with blood and semen Strangely enough the underwear and baniyan though discovered and seized, on an information given by the accused and on his pointing out apparently on a statement recorded under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, have not been produced and exhibited in the court\tRatio of the decision\nWhat happened to these clothes is not known\tRatio of the decision\nThere is not investigation directed towards finding out and no evidence worth its name collected and adduced in the court to show that the underwear and baniyan were of the accused\tRatio of the decision\nInsofar as baniyan is concerned, it has no stains of any type on it and therefore its discovery and seizure is meaningless and irrelevant\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as the underwear is concerned, the investigation suffers from another infirmity also\tRatio of the decision\nBlood sam-ple of the accused was not collected and therefore not grouped\tRatio of the decision\nNo evidence is available to show as to what was the blood group of the accused and therefore the possibility of blood on the underwear being of the accused himself cannot be and is not ruled out\tRatio of the decision\nThe number and extent of spread of stains is also not known\tRatio of the decision\nShri Sushil Kumar Jain, the learned counsel for the accused-appellant has placed reliance on Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit v. State of Maharashtra, AIR (1981\tArgument\nSC 765 1980 Indlaw SC 47\tArgument\nTherein a charge under Sections 376 and 302  IPC  was sought to be substantiated on circumstanctial evidence\tArgument\nOne of the circumstan-tial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of 'B' group was found on the accused's pant which blood group was also of the deceased\tArgument\nAnother circumstantial evidence relied on was that a stain of semen was found on the under-pant of the accused\tArgument\nThis Court held that the presence of blood-stain of 'B' group measuring 0.5 cm\tArgument\nin diameter on the appellant's pant and of a dried stain of semen on his under-pant, were circumstances for too feeble to establish that the appellant raped or murdered the victim\tArgument\nB' group is not uncommon group of blood and no effort was made to exclude the possibility that the blood of the accused belonged to the same group\tArgument\nAs regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant's under-pant, the court observed that the accused was a grown-up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl\tArgument\nIn the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident\tArgument\nOn his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person\tArgument\nPresence of semen stain on underwear, assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard, is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question\tArgument\nSo also the discov-ery of 'B' group blood-stain on the underwear cannot be treated as an incrimi-nating piece of evidence against the accused connecting him with the crime because there is no evidence that the underwear belonged to the accused and further the possiblity of the underwear being stained with the blood of the person to whom it belonged, or the accused if he was wearing it has not been ruled out\tArgument\nFalse plea of alibi\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court has gone completely amiss in holding that a plea of alibi was taken by the accused and that was found to be false\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused has not stated during his statement under Section 313 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. and nowhere suggested during cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that at the time of the incident he was at a place wherefrom he could not have reached the place of the offence on the date and at the time of its commission\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough the dead body of the victim was found on the outskirts of the village, however, there is no material available on record to fix the place and the likely time at which rape was committed on S and then she was murdered\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is being treated as the plea of alibi by the trial court and the High Court is this\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused appears to have been engaged as a causal (not regular) gate-keeper at 'Hira Moti'-a local talkies\tRatio of the decision\nThe proprietor of the cinema hall was examined to state that on 18th and 19th March the accused had taken leave from his job and during those days he was not present on duty\tRatio of the decision\nThis piece of evidence was put to the accused during his statement under Section 313 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. and in reply he stated 'Galat Hai' (not correct\tRatio of the decision\nThe purpose of asking questions during examination under Section 313 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. is to afford the accused personally an opportunity of explaining any incriminating circumstance so appearing in evidence against him\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused may or may not avail the opportunity for offering his explanation\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused did not avail the opportunity and stood short by simply stating that the statement of cinema owner was not correct\tRatio of the decision\nLiteral meaning of alibi is 'elsewhere\tRatio of the decision\nIn law this term is used to express that defence in a criminal prosecution, where the party accused, in order to prove that he could not have committed the crime charged against him, offers evidence that he was in a different place at that time\tRatio of the decision\nThe plea taken should be capable of meaning that having regard to the time and place when and where he is alleged to have committed the offence, he could not have been present\tRatio of the decision\nThe plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place\tRatio of the decision\nSee Law Lexicon, P. Ramnath Iyer, Second Edition, P.87\tRatio of the decision\nDenial by an accused of an assertion made by his employer that the accused was on leave of absence from duty on the date of offence does not, by any stretch of reasoning or logic, amount to pleading alibi\tRatio of the decision\nWe are clearly of the opinion that the accused-appellant has not taken a plea of alibi and therefore the question of finding it false, and then drawing an inference adverse to him, does not arise at all\tRatio of the decision\nv) Absconding of the accused Was the accused absconding at all\tRatio of the decision\nGrave injustice has been done to the accused by holding it as a fact that the accused was absconding after the date of the incident and then treating the so-called absconding as a piece of incrimi-nating circumstantial evidence against the accused\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to Harish Chand Sharma, the accused was arrested on 3.4.1991 (vide Exbt\tRatio of the decision\nP/21) at Behror, which is a place situated at a distance of about 30-35 kms\tRatio of the decision\nfrom village Kotputli where the incident had taken place\tRatio of the decision\nThough the accused is alleged to have been arrested at Behror but the memo of arrest was not prepared at Behror; it was prepared at village Kotputli\tRatio of the decision\nThe memo of arrest does not state the arrest of accused having been made at Behror\tRatio of the decision\nIf the accused was arrested at Behror there is no reason why the memo of arrest should not have been prepared at village Behror\tRatio of the decision\nAt least this fact should have been mentioned in the memo of arrest even if the same was prepared at village Kotputli\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly, Harish Chand Sharma himself states that between 19.3.1991 and 25.3.1991 the ac-cused was called several times at the police station and on 21.3.1991 itself he was called twice in a day\tRatio of the decision\nThus, he was always available to the police\tRatio of the decision\nKalu Ram, PW5, accompanied by a friend Santosh, PW9, had gone to see a movie in cinema talkies Heera-Moti two days after the date of the incident and there the accused was present on his duty\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence adduced by the prosecution to hold that soon after the date of the offence the accused was found missing from his residence or the place of his employment and was not available, though searched, at the place or places where normally he ought to have been\tRatio of the decision\nHence, it could not have been held that the accused was absconding\tRatio of the decision\nConclusion\tRatio of the decision\nThus, none of the pieces of evidence relied on as incriminating, by the trial court and the High Court, can be treated as incriminating pieces of circumstantial evidence against the accused\tRatio of the decision\nThough the offence is gruesome and revolts the human conscience but an accused can be convicted only on legal evidence and if only a chain of circumstantial evidence has been so forged as to rule out the possibility of any other reasonable hypothesis excepting the guilt of the accused\tRatio of the decision\nIn Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit's case 1980 Indlaw SC 47 (supra), this Court cautioned - \"human nature is too willing, when faced with brutal crimes, to spin stories out of strong suspicions\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court has held time and again that between may be true and must be true there is a long distance to travel which must be covered by clear, cogent and unimpeachable evidence by the prosecu-tion before an accused is condemned a convict\tRatio of the decision\nThe Trial Court and the High Court have proceeded on an assumption of availability of five pieces forging links in the chain of circumstantial evi-dence out of which we have found, as stated hereinabove, four of the alleged circumstances not to be pieces of incriminating circumstantial evidence at all\tRatio of the decision\nWe are left with circumstance no\tRatio of the decision\n3 only, i.e., recovery of underwear and baniyan stained with semen and human blood group 'B', which alone, in the fact and circumstances of the case discussed hereinabove cannot form basis of conviction of the accused-appellant for the offence charged\tRatio of the decision\nBefore parting with the case we would like to place on record, an observation of ours, touching an aspect of the case\tRatio of the decision\nThere are clueless crimes committed\tRatio of the decision\nThe factum of a cognizable crime having been committed is known but neither the identity of the accused is disclosed nor is there any indication available of the witnesses who would be able to furnish useful and relevant evidence\tRatio of the decision\nSuch offences put to test the wits of an investigating officer\tRatio of the decision\nA vigilant investigating officer, well-versed with the techniques of the job, is in a position to collect the threads of evidence finding out the path which leads to the culprit\tRatio of the decision\nThe ends, which the administration of cirminal justice serves, are not achieved merely by catching hold of the culprit\tRatio of the decision\nThe accusation has to be proved to hilt in a court of law\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence of investigating officer given in the court should have a rhythm explaining step by step how the investigation proceeded leading to detection of the offender and collection of evidence against him\tRatio of the decision\nThis is necessary to exclude the likelihood of any innocent having been picked up and branded as culprit and then the gravity of the offence arousing human sympathy persuading the mind to be carried away by doubtful or dubious circumstances treating them as of 'beyond doubt' evidentiary value\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeals are allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nConviction of the accused-appellant under Sections 302 and 376(2)(f) of Indian Penal Code is set aside\tRuling by Present Court\nHe is acquitted of the charges framed against him\tRuling by Present Court\nHe shall be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any other offence\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

            "text": "Three civil appeals, stemming from three revision petitions to the High Court of Orissa under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951 (Orissa Act I of 1952) (for short, the Act) have reached this Court, thanks to special leave granted to the appellant, who is common in all the cases\tFacts\nThe High Court, after deciding various issues, remanded the cases to the Compensation Officer under the Act, after over-ruling most of the contentions pressed before it by the appellant\tFacts\nShri Achutananda Purohit, appellant, was the intermediary in respect of vast forests and other lands comprised in the estate of Jujumura in the district of Sambalpur\tFacts\nThis estate vested in the State on April 1, 1960 by force of the Act and the crucial question agitated before us, consequentially turns on the quantum of compensation awardable under Chapter V of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant has received around Rs\tFacts\n3,00,000/- but much more, according to him, is due and this controversy can be settled by examining his specific points\tFacts\nShri Purohit, appellant, is an Advocate by profession and is 83 years old\tFacts\nHe has argued in person and with passion\tRatio of the decision\nWe have listened with patience to all his submissions, good, bad and indifferent\tRatio of the decision\nIf we may anticipate ourselves, none of the nine submissions has appealed to us, save to the extent the High Court has upheld\tRatio of the decision\nEven so, a minimal narration of the facts and a brief consideration of each argument is necessary and we proceed to do so\tRatio of the decision\nWhile his arguments did not impress us, we were touched by his concluding words that he had been born and had grown in an adivasi village, in the only brahmin family and, in his evening years of life, proposed to give a substantial part of the compensation the State would give him for adivasi welfare\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough he waxed sentimentally on this note, he did not convince us on his contentions\tRatio of the decision\nWith these prefatory observations, we proceed to formulate the many points urged and give our findings and reasons, one after the other\tRatio of the decision\nWe are directly concerned with the issue of compensation which is dealt with, as earlier stated, in Chapter V of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Compensation Officer is charged with fixing the quantum in the prescribed manner\tRatio of the decision\nA compensation assessment roll containing the gross asset and net income of each estate, together with the compensation payable in respect of such estate, has to be prepared by him\tRatio of the decision\nOf course, when there is joint ownership, s. 24 stipulates that the compensation shall be determined for the estate as a whole and not separately for each of the shares therein\tStatute\nS. 26 has great relevance as it lays down the method of arriving at the gross asset and s. 27 has like significance as it focuses on the manner in which the net income from an estate shall be computed by deducting certain items from the gross asset of the estate\tStatute\ns\tStatute\n28 states how the amount of compensation is to be determined and the methodology of payment\tStatute\nThere are a few other s.s in Chapter VI which deal with payment of compensation\tStatute\nthe Act also provides for appeal, second appeal and revision, the last being to the High Court and the earlier ones being to the Collector and a Board constituted under s. 22\tStatute\nThe rule-making power is vested in the government under s. 47 and there is a routine 'removal of difficulties' clause contained in s. 50\tStatute\nThese furnish in bare outline the provisions with which we are directly concerned\tStatute\nAgainst the background of law just projected, we may set out Shri Purohit's points which, if we may say so, are substantially the same as have been argued by him in revision before the High Court with partial success\tRatio of the decision\nFor convenience of reference, we may extract the statement by the High Court of the contentions urged before it (and repeated before us) by the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe provisions of s. 37(3) read with s. 26(2\tRuling by Lower Court\nb) (v) of the Act make it clear that the date of vesting is the last date by which the calculation of compensation should have been made\tRuling by Lower Court\nAs admittedly compensation had not been calculated by the date of vesting, the Compensation Officer lost his statutory jurisdiction to do so\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt is this Court which, by its order dated 10-4-1969 in Civil Revisions 201, 202 and 203 of 1968 conferred new jurisdiction on the Compensation Officer to deal freshly with the case and therefore notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, the compensation has to be calculated according to the directions given by the Court; (2) The Court was fully aware of the statutory provision in s. 26(2\tRuling by Lower Court\nb) (v) of the Act, but in spite of it, the direction was that the Divisional Forest Officer should make the appraisement\tRuling by Lower Court\nThere was no direction that this report of the D.F.O. should be further subject to the approval of the Chief Conservator of Forests\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe calculation made by the Chief Conservator of Forests therefore has no statutory force but could be just a piece of evidence\tRuling by Lower Court\nBut as the Court directed that no further evidence on behalf of the State should be received, Ext\tRuling by Lower Court\nA/1 is inadmissible in evidence\tRuling by Lower Court\n3) Assuming that in spite of the directions of the court the Compensation Offi cer is entitled to follow the procedure laid down in S. 26(2)(b)(v), the expression 'subject to the approval of the Chief Conservator of Forests' does not refer to the appraisement made by the D.F.O. but refers to his appointment\tRuling by Lower Court\n4) Assuming that s. 26(2) (b) (v) would have full force, what it contemplates is that the appraisement must be made by the D.F.O., and it is subject to the approval by the Chief Conservator of Forests\tRuling by Lower Court\nBut what has happened here is that the Chief Conservator himself made the appraisement without referring to the appraisement made by the D.F.O. and as such the appraisement made by the Chief Conservator is invalid\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe report of the Chief Conservator of Forests is also invalid because of the fact that the appraisement is made only with reference to the area of the disputed forests without taking into consideration the density of growth therein\tRuling by Lower Court\n6) Unlike in case of fisheries etc\tRuling by Lower Court\nwhere the Actual income is to be included in the gross assets, in the case of forests, the assumed income and not the Actual income is to be included\tRuling by Lower Court\nDuring the agricultural year immediately preceding the abolition, the petitioners had not actually derived any income from the forests and as such they were under no obligation to pay any income-tax on such income\tRuling by Lower Court\nTherefore, deduction of income-tax from the gross assets is illegal and unwarranted\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe slab-system of calculation of compensation in the Act providing smaller multiples for estates yielding larger income is unconstitutional\tRuling by Lower Court\n8) Compensation money should be so calculated that the purchasing power of the amount of compensation to be paid on the date of actual payment will not be less than its purchasing power on the date of vesting; and (9) Interest should be calculated at not less than 12% per annum from the date of vesting till payment\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe meat of the matter, the primary question agitated in the appeal, lopping off the fringe issues of lesser import, consists in the statutory methodology and functionaries prescribed by the Act for quantifying the compensation and the compliance therewith by the statutory machinery in the case of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nBut before examining this essential issue we may dispose of the minor points pressed, so that the deck may be cleared for dealing with what deserves to be dealt with\tRatio of the decision\nPoint No. 9, in the catalogue already given, relates to the claim for 12% interest on the amount of compensation as against the statutory rate of 2 1/2\tRatio of the decision\nThe policy of the law of agrarian reform postulates the extinguishment of ancient privileges and cornering of land resources, and the socioeconomic yardstick is different from what applies to ordinary purchases of real estate and this is manifest in the special provisions contained in Art\tStatute\n31A and Art\tStatute\n31B of the Constitution\tStatute\nA similar principle applies to the award of interest which may sometimes be notional when feudal interests are puffed out\tRatio of the decision\nWe cannot import the notion of prevailing bank rates in such situations\tRatio of the decision\nThe dynamic rule of law, with a social mission, makes a meaningful distinction between rights steeped in the old system and compensation for deprivation of those interests, on the one hand, and the ordinary commercial transactions or regulation of rights untinged by social transformation urges, on the other\tRatio of the decision\nThis gives rationality to the seeming disparity\tRatio of the decision\nHolmes once commented: 'It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that\tRatio of the decision\nso it was laid down in the time of Henry IV\tRatio of the decision\nHere there is good reason to depart from the old rule of full compensation and it perhaps legitimates the reduced rate of recompense\tRatio of the decision\nMoreover, the High Court has rightly pointed out that the validity of s. 37(3) of the Act which fixes a small rate of interest on the compensation amount has been upheld by the Supreme Court in Gajapati Narayan's Case\tRatio of the decision\nPoint No. 8 has only to be stated to be rejected\tRatio of the decision\nThe contention is that on the date of vesting, which was well over two decades ago, the purchasing power of the rupee was much higher than its present value\tRatio of the decision\nIt is more or less a world phenomenon that the erosi on in value of the unit of currency has been taking place, but this invisible devaluation owing to the inflationary spiral does not affect the quantum of monetary compensation prescribed by statute\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purposes of the law, the rupee of long ago is the same as the rupee of today, although for the purposes of the market place and cost-of living, the housewife's answer may be different\tRatio of the decision\nLaw is sometimes blind\tRatio of the decision\nThe next point in the reverse order is equally unsubstantial and may be disposed of right away\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant challenges the slab system of compensation provided in the Act which awards smaller multiples for estates yielding larger incomes, on the score of violation of the fundamental rights under the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nThe short answer is that Art\tRatio of the decision\n31(3) read with Art\tRatio of the decision\n31(2) bars any challenge to the amount of compensation on acquisition by the State subject to compliance with the prescriptions in the said sub-Articles, on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate\tRatio of the decision\nPresidential assent has been accorded to this State Act and so the ban operates\tRatio of the decision\nMoreover, Art\tRatio of the decision\n31A repels the applicability of Arts\tRatio of the decision\n14, 19 and 31 to the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein etc\tRatio of the decision\nThis provision directly demolishes the contention of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nPoint No. 6 in the list of contentions earlier reproduced is also bereft of force and we may make short shrift of it\tRatio of the decision\nThe argument is that for certain reasons the appellant could not derive and actual income from the forests taken over by the State from him and therefore there was no income-tax payable on any agricultural income from these forests\tArgument\nThe contention is that therefore in arriving at the next income the deduction of income-tax is not permissible\tArgument\nHere again, the flaw in the submission consists in mis-reading s. 27 of the Act which expressly states that the net income from an estate shall be computed by deducting from the gross assets of such estate any sum 'which was payable by the intermediary as income-tax in respect of any income derived from such estate for the previous agricultural year\tRatio of the decision\nNo income, therefore no income-tax, and therefore no deduction, is the syllogism of Shri Purohit\tRatio of the decision\nHe forgets that in the case of forests it is the assumed income and not the Actual income that forms the basis of calculation of compensation\tRatio of the decision\nIndeed, if the Actual income were to be the foundation for computation of compensation on the premise that not actual income has accrued, the compensation might be zero\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other hand, statutory compensation is provided for on the formula of assumed income in the previous year\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly, an assumed income- tax also has to be worked out and deducted\tRatio of the decision\nIf a notional income on the assumed basis can be used for fixing compensation, a notional income-tax can be calculated and deducted\tRatio of the decision\nThe confusion that vitiates the argument is prompted by a circular letter of government regarding non-deductibility of income-tax due to the State from the amount of compensation lying to the credit of estate holders\tRatio of the decision\nWe have examined the circular letter and are satisfied that it has no relevance to a situation like the present and it deals with a totally different matter\tRatio of the decision\nIn short, s. 27 properly construed, cannot lend itself to the meaning imputed to it by the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe serious question that survives for consideration is covered by the remaining points which more or less overlap\tRatio of the decision\nThe statutory scheme of compensation for forest lands consists of machinery for assessment of the net income which is multiplied on a sliding scale and the method of challenge to the determination by the aggrieved owner of State\tRatio of the decision\nS. 26(2\tStatute\nb) (v) is relevant here and may be set out:- \"26(2\tStatute\ngross asset' when used with reference to an estate means the aggregate of the rents, including all cesses, which were payable in respect of the estate for the previous agricultural year- (b) by the raiyats or any other persons cultivating the land other than the land settled with the intermediary or intermediaries under Sub-s\tStatute\n1) of S. 7 and includes\tStatute\nv) gross income from forests calculated on the basis of the appraisement made of annual yield of the forests on the date of vesting by a Forest Officer subject to the approval of the Chief Conservator of Forests, such Forest Officer being not below the rank of a Divisional Forest Officer to be appointed in this behalf by the State Government\tStatute\nThe expression 'Forest Officer', used here, has been explained in s. 26\tStatute\nSo the first step is for the Government to appoint Forest Officers from out of D.F.Os\tRatio of the decision\nin the Forest Department, for the purposes of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nThose Officers ascertain the income from the forest concerned and the figure so fixed is subject to the approval of the C.C.F. (Chief Conservator of Forests), presumably the top expert in the department\tRatio of the decision\nThe power to approve implies the power to disapprove or modify but not to report or arrive at an income de hors the Forest Officer's Report altogether\tRatio of the decision\nThe section is clear that the gross income from forests must be calculated on the basis of appraisal of the annual yield on the date of vesting firstly, by a Forest Officer and, secondly, by the Chief Conservator of Forests screening it and approving it\tRatio of the decision\nIndeed, preliminary to the appraisal operation, the intermediary receives a notice in Form 'D' (rule 13) and he is expected to furnish a return of the relevant particulars and supporting information to enable correct appraisement\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case, the appellant did submit the 'D' return to the Compensation Officer and adduced some evidence to substantiate it\tRatio of the decision\nThe Compensation Officer passed an order adverse to the appellant, where upon he filed an appeal to the Collector which was rejected\tFacts\nA Second Appeal followed before the Board of Revenue which was dismissed\tFacts\nLater, revision petition were filed before the High Court and G. K. Misra J., set aside the order disallowing the inclusion of the income from forests for ascertainment of compensation and directed a remand to the Compensation Officer\tFacts\nThe said order (the relevant portion of which we are concerned) runs thus:- \"He would immediately call upon the Divisional Forest Officer to make appraisement within three months from the receipt of the record\tFacts\nThe appraisement can be scientifically done by looking to the age of the trees as they stand now\tFacts\nIt is open to the petitioners to give evidence that after the date of vesting many of the trees and forest produce have been removed\tFacts\nBesides the evidence already on record would be taken into consideration\tFacts\nThe Divisional Forest Officer who would make the appraisement will be examined as a witness for the Compensation Officer and would be subjected to cross-examination\tFacts\nNo other evidence would be permissible as the State has not chosen to give any other evidence\tFacts\nUnder Rule 13(1-c) of the Orissa Estates Abolition Rules, 1952 the compensation officer may rely upon such other materials as may otherwise be ascertained by him\tFacts\nBut in such a case the materials must be brought to the notice of the petitioners who would be entitled to cross-examine the witnesses connected therewith and may give rebutting evidence\tFacts\nThe compensation case is to be disposed of by the compensation officer within six months from today (104-1969) with intimation to this Court\tFacts\nStrictly speaking, the statutory requirement is for initial appraisal of the annual income by the Forest Officer\tRatio of the decision\nThe use of the expression 'Divisional Forest Officers is erroneous although Forest Officers are appointed from among Divisional Forest Officers\tRatio of the decision\nEqually clearly, a slight error has crept into the Judge's order because he does not make any reference specifically to the statutory requirement of approval of the Chief Conservator of Forests of the appraisement made by the Forest Officer\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, what followed is interesting though erroneous\tRatio of the decision\nThe District Forest Officer (who, incidentally, happens to be a Forest Officer under the Act, having been appointed as required thereunder) made his appraisal of the annual income and submitted to the Chief Conservator who altered the annual yield and reduced it substantially\tFacts\nBut he pointed out that the Forest Officer had omitted to include the income from kendu leaves and added that sum to the income from forests\tFacts\nEven so, the total figure was less than what the Divisional Forest Officer had recommended\tFacts\nThe Compensation officer accepted the report of the Chief Conservator and made the statutory calculation on that date\tFacts\nBoth the State and the appellant filed appeals to the Collector which were dismissed\tFacts\nA second appeal was filed by the appellant before the Board of Revenue without success\tFacts\nThen followed three revision petitions to the High Court which led to the order of remand now attacked before us in the present appeals\tFacts\nFrom this narrative, what follows is that the Chief Conservator had substituted his appraisement which was accepted by the statutory tribunal\tFacts\nIndeed, there was a fundamental difference in the basis adopted by the Forest Officer and the Chief Conservator in the matter of assessing the income of the forests in question\tRatio of the decision\nWe need not go into this detail except for the purpose of noticing that what the Chief Conservator did was not to approve wholly or in a modified form what the Forest Officer did but to make his own appraisal independently and without reference to the report of the statutory functionary, viz., the Forest Officer\tRatio of the decision\nThis was wrong and contrary to s. 26, as was contended by the appellant and in a way accepted by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nWe are in agreement with the course adopted by the High Court and the reasoning which has prevailed with it\tRuling by Present Court\nThe direction given by the learned Judge in the remand order is correct although it may require a little clarification\tRuling by Present Court\nHaving heard the appellant at some length, we see no flaw in the High Court's order on this aspect of the matter\tRatio of the decision\nIt is astonishing that anyone should urge, as the appellant did, that the date of vesting is the last date by which the calculation of compensation should have been made and since that had not been done, the Compensation Officer had become functus officio in awarding compensation\tRatio of the decision\nBefore the date of vesting the State never can, nor does, fix the compensation through the Compensation officer in any of the agrarian reform laws, and these compensation operations are post statutory exercises\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore there is no substance in the functus officio argument\tRatio of the decision\nIf the officer had no jurisdiction, the land would be gone because of the vesting provision and no compensation would be forthcoming for want of jurisdiction-a consequence the appellant never wants\tRatio of the decision\nTechnicality can be frightened away by technicality\tRatio of the decision\nNor is it right to contend, as the appellant did, that the Compensation Officer's jurisdiction was created by the order of remand by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nNo, it was created by the statute and canalised by the order of remand\tRatio of the decision\nIt follows that, after the present second remand, the re-appraisal of the annual net income cannot be done solely by the Forest Officer without securing the approval of the Chief Conservator\tRatio of the decision\nNor can the Compensation Officer by-pass the Chief Conservator on the misunderstood strength of the High Court's first order of remand\tRatio of the decision\nThe true legal drill is\tRatio of the decision\nand this holds good after the second remand order-that the Forest officer will do the appraisement of the annual income, forward his report to the Chief Conservator of Forests who will take the said report into consideration and, if necessary, make modifications therein or approve it with such changes as he deems fit\tRatio of the decision\nCertainly the Chief Conservator cannot be ignored by the Compensation Officer nor can the Chief Conservator ignore the assessment made by the Forest

Raju was converted into a private limited, company with its headquarters at Visakhapatnam\tFacts\nWe shall refer to this company throughout as the AECO\tFacts\nIt obtained licences from the Government under the Electricity Act for supply of electrical energy to Visakhapatnam, Anakapalli and some other places\tFacts\nAs the AECO did not have the necessary capital to undertake the work Raju floated in the year 1933 a public limited company called Visakhapatnam Electric Supply Corporation Ltd.,  and another in the year 1936 called the Anakapalli Electric Supply Corporation Ltd\tFacts\nThe AECO transferred its licences for the supply of electrical energy to the consumers of Visakhapatnam to VESCO and similarly transferred to AECO the licence to supply electrical energy to consumers at Anakapalli\tFacts\nThe AECO was appointed Managing Agent for each of these corporations under separate agreements\tFacts\nSome time later other industrial concerns, the Andhra Cements Ltd., Vi jayawada and the East Coast Ceremics\tFacts\nRajahmurthy were started apparently by Raju himself- and the AECO was appointed the Managing Agent of each of these concerns\tFacts\nThe original managing agency agreement in favour of AECO with respect to VESCO was for a period of 15 years i.e., from 1933 to 1948 and was later renewed for the remaining term of the currency of the licence granted by the Government under the Electricity Act\tFacts\nA mention may be made of the fact that in June, 1952 the VESCO undertaking was acquired by the Government under the provisions of the \"'Electricity Undertaking Acquisition Act\" but nothing turns on it\tFacts\nThe VESCO had its own Board of Directors while the AECO had also its own separate Board of Directors\tFacts\nThe VESCO had no Managing Director but at each meeting of its Board of Directors one of the Directors used to be elected Chairman\tFacts\nThe same practice was followed at the meeting of the general body of the shareholders\tFacts\nThe AECO on the other band always had a Managing Director, first of whom was D.L.N. Raju\tFacts\nHe died in the year 1939 and was succeeded by R.K.N.G. Raju, an Advocate of Rajahmundry\tFacts\nThis person, however, did not shift to Visakhapatnam on his becoming the Managing Director but continued to stay most of the time at Rajahmundry\tFacts\nAccording to the prosecution both these concerns were running smoothly and efficiently during the lifetime of D.L.N. Raju because he was personally attending to their affairs\tArgument\nHis successor, however, apart from the fact that be continued to be staying mostly at Rajahmundry, was also interested in several other ventures, including a sugar factory at Dewas in Central India\tArgument\nEventually many of those ventures failed\tArgument\nAccording to the prosecution the second Raju was not bestowing sufficient care and attention on the affairs of VESCO\tArgument\nThe AECO as Managing Agents of VESCO had appointed in the year 1939 one D.V. Appala Raju, a trusted employee, as its representative and as the secretary of VESCO\tFacts\nIn 1944 this person resigned from his appointments and started his own business in radio and electrical goods in the name of D. Brothers\tFacts\nHe was succeeded by T. Visweswara Rao, P.W. 6, an employee of the AECO\tFacts\nThe respondent No. 1\tRatio of the decision\nGaneswara Rao was also an old employee of AECO, having been appointed a stenotypist in the year 1923 on an initial salary of Rs\tRatio of the decision\np.m\tRatio of the decision\nEventually he became the Head Clerk therein\tRatio of the decision\nHe pressed his claim for appointment as Secretary of VESCO and representative of the Managing Agents at Visakhapatnam and R .H.G\tRatio of the decision\nRaju appointed him to that post\tRatio of the decision\nAll this is not disputed\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent No. 1, even after his appointment on two posts connected with VESCO, continued to work with the AECO also whose business had by then been confined only to that of Managing Agents of the four companies floated by D.L.N. Raju\tRatio of the decision\nIt is the prosecution case that as Secretary of VESCO and the resident representative of the Managing Agents, the respondent No\tArgument\nI was attending to the day to day affairs of VESCO, which included the receiving of all sums of money due to VESCO, spending money for the purpose of VESCO attending to the appointment, supervision and control of the staff of VESCO, purchasing materials required for the purpose of VESCO and supervising over the accounts of VESCO\tArgument\nHe was thus all important with respect to the every day affairs of VESCO\tArgument\nHis dual capacity enabled the respondent No\tArgument\nI to earn the confidence not only of the Directors of AECO but also of those of VESCO\tArgument\nThe accounts maintained by the VESCO used to be explained by him not only to the Directors but also to the shareholders\tArgument\nThe knowledge of the Financial position of VESCO obtained by them used to be derived essentially from the respondent No. 1\tArgument\nAs Secretary of VESCO it was his duty to convene the meetings of the Board of Directors, to present before them the periodical statement of receipts and expenditure of VESCO, to convene meetings of the General Body, to prepare the Managing Agents' report and the Director's report as also to see to the presentation of auditors' report and the statement of accounts\tArgument\nThe explanations of the Managing Agents and the Directors of VESCO with respect to the items mentioned in the orders of the Board used also to be placed by him before the shareholders\tArgument\nIt was also his duty to have the accounts of VESCO audited by the auditors elected by the general body and to produce before the auditors the relevant accounts, vouchers, bank statements and so on\tArgument\nThere were no complaints about the management of the affairs of VESCO or the AECO till the end of 1946 or the beginning of 1947\tArgument\nOne significant fact, however, which occurred prior to 1946 - is referred to by the prosecution\tArgument\nTill the -year 1945 Messrs C. P. Rao & Co., a firm of Chartered Accountants were the auditors of VESCO but after the respondent No\tArgument\nI became Secretary\tArgument\none B. Rajan was elected Auditor not only for VESCO but for all the other four concerns, including AECO\tArgument\nThis person was Auditor for Greenlands Hotel at Visakhapatnam\tArgument\nof which the respondent No\tArgument\nI was a Director\tArgument\nR.K.N.G. Raju took till towards the end of 1947 and died at Madras in April, 1948\tArgument\nAccording to the prosecution the respondent No. I wanted to take advantage of this fact and conceived of a scheme for misappropriating as much money belonging to VESCO as possible before the managing agency agreement of AECO came to an end in October, 1948\tArgument\nI secured the promotion of the approver K.V. Ramana, who was originally Accounts Clerk to the post of Senior Accountant\tArgument\nSimilarly K. V. Gopala Raju was transferred from the post of Stores Clerk to the general department and K.S.N. Murty, the discharged accused, was appointed Stores Clerk in his place\tArgument\nLater, however, Murty was also got transferred to the general section and replaced by P. W. 18\tArgument\nSrinivasa Rao originally a stores boy\tArgument\nThe approver who was originally an Accounts clerk with the AECO was, it may be mentioned, appointed a cashier in VESCO in 1946 at the instance of the respondent No\tArgument\nI and was thus beholden to him\tArgument\nHe was later promoted as Senior Accountant and in his place the respondent No. 2\tArgument\nLaksbminarayana Rao was appointed the Cashier\tArgument\nAccording to the prosecution the respondent No\tArgument\nI took both the approver and Lakshminarayana Rao in his confidence as also some other persons \"known and unknown\" for carrying out his nefarious purpose, namely, the misappropriation of the funds of VESCO during the subsistence of AECO's managing agency of VESCO\tArgument\nThe conspiracy is said to have been hatched in the year 1947 and falsification of accounts and misappropriation of funds of VESCO went on till the end of the accounting year\tArgument\nThe term of the managing agency was renewed in 1943 and AECO con- tinued to be managing agents until the VESCO was taken over by the Government in 1952\tArgument\nI continued to be the Secretary of VESCO and resident representative of the Managing Agents throughout the period of conspiracy\tArgument\nAfter the death of R.K.N.G. Raju, it was discovered that the AECO was indebted to many concerns which were under its managing agency, the liability being shown either as that of AECO or that of R.K.N.G. Raju personally\tArgument\nAgain, the VESCO was shown as indebted to the Andhra Cement, ; to the extent of Rs\tArgument\n42, 000\tArgument\nThis amount was, however, paid by the AECO from the funds of VESCO\tArgument\nI and some of his friends were in search of a rich and substantial man who would be amenable to them to fill the post of Managing Director of AECO\tArgument\nEventually their choice fell on G. V. Subba Raju, P. W. 25, a resident of Manchili, who held a large number of shares in the AECO and who was, besides, related to R.K.N.G. Raju by marriage\tFacts\nIt is said that this person has not received much education and knows only bow to sign his name in English\tFacts\nHe was assured that by consenting to become the Managing Director be would not be required to discharge onerous duties and that the respondent No\tFacts\nI would look to all the affairs of VESCO\tFacts\nHe was also told that apart from signing important papers which may be sent to him by the respondent No. I from time to time to Manchili or wherever be might be would have no work to do\tFacts\nHe agreed and was elected Managing Director of AECO in the middle of 1948\tFacts\nUpon this understanding he accepted the position offered to him\tFacts\nThe VESCO used to receive large amounts of money from high tension power consumers such as the railways, K. G. Hospital, the Port Administration, the Andhra University etc\tFacts\nby cheques\tFacts\nBut domestic consumers usually paid their bills in cash to the bill collectors who used to hand over their collections to the respondent No. 2\tFacts\nThe respondent No. 2 was asked by the respondent No\tFacts\nI to maintain a private note book\tFacts\nIn \"that book payments which used to be made by respondent No. 2 on the basis of slips issued by the respondent No\tFacts\nI  used to be noted and the amount totalled up at the end of the day\tFacts\nThis amount was posted in VESCO's Cash Handover Book as \"'by safe\" indicating that this amount was kept in the safe, though in fact it was not\tFacts\nOn the basis of the entries in the Handover Book the final accounts were written up\tFacts\nI opened four personal accounts in different banks, including the Imperial Bank of India\tFacts\nWhen the respondent No\tFacts\nI had to issue a personal cheque on any of these Banks he used to ask the second respondent to send an equivalent amount to the Bank concerned for being credited to his account\tFacts\nThese amounts also used to be noted in the private note book and entered\tFacts\nAnother thing which the respondent No\tFacts\nI initiated was opening a heading in the ledger called \"advance purchase of materials\tFacts\nAmounts which had been misappropriated used to be posted therein though in fact no orders were placed for any material\tFacts\nIt may be mentioned that Subba Raju used to visit Visakhapatnam twice a month and check up the account books\tFacts\nAt that time it used to be represented to him that the amounts which were shown to be in the safe and not found therein  had been sent to the Bank for being deposited\tFacts\nApparently Subba Raju was fully satisfied with this and other explanations and, therefore, he appointed one C. S. Raju, who was the Manager of Andhra Cements to supervise over the affairs of VESCO.Apparently because of this a new method of misappropriation was adopted by the respondents by starting in the VESCO account books, an account called \"suspense account\tFacts\nA lakh of rupees passed through that account\tFacts\nAmounts which were misappropriated used to find their way in this account\tFacts\nA new cash book was also said to have been prepared by the conspirators with the object of covering up the misappropriations which had been made\tFacts\nSubba Raju was not satisfied with the nature of supervision exercised by C. S. Raju over the affairs of VESCO because he used to look only at the cash book entries of the days on which he paid visits to VESCO's office, to which he used to go with previous intimation\tFacts\nBesides that, C. S. Raju's management of Andhra Cements had landed it into a loss of Rs\tFacts\n30, 000\tFacts\nBecause of all these things he had C. S. Raju replaced towards the end of the year 1951 by one Subbaramayya, a retired Finance Officer from the Madras Electricity Board both as a Director of Andhra Cements and as a Supervisor over the accounts of VESCO\tFacts\nSubbaramayya took his work seriously and called for information on a number of points from the respondent No. 1\tFacts\nHe, however, was unable to obtain any information\tFacts\nIn January, 1952 he therefore brought one S. G. Krishna Aiyar who had vast experience in the maintenance of accounts of electrical undertaking's having been Chief Accountant of the South Madras Electric Supply Corporation, to undertake an investigation and then to act as Financial Adviser\tFacts\nIn the meantime on November 29, 1951 there was a meeting of the General Body at which the accounts were, among other things, to be considered\tFacts\nThere was a considerable uproar at that meeting because the respondent No. 1 said that the Auditor's report had not been received\tFacts\nThe shareholders felt that the report had been received but was being suppressed or deliberately withheld\tFacts\nHowever, the meeting was postponed and eventually held on December 9, 1951\tFacts\nOn that date the respondent No. 1 produced the auditor's report\tFacts\nAccording to the prosecution the report is a forged document\tArgument\nThat was also the feeling-of a number of shareholders who wanted to see the original but one Dutt who was Chairman of the meeting after seeing Ex\tFacts\nP. 234 said that the report seemed to be a genuine one\tFacts\nS. G. Krishna Aiyar after his appointment in January, 1952, made close enquiry and submitted an interim report\tFacts\nThat report showed that during the period 1948-49 Rs. 33, 271-10-0 shown as paid to the Andhra Power System were in fact not paid\tFacts\nThe respondent No. 1 on being asked to explain said that he would give his explanation to the Managing Director\tFacts\nThe Interim Report showed that there was a shortage of about Rs\tFacts\n90, 000/- for this period\tFacts\nOn February 12, 1952 the respondent No\tFacts\nI wrote to the Managing Director admitting his responsibility and agreed to make good the amounts found short or such other amounts as would be found short up to the end of March, 1952\tFacts\nFurther scrutiny of the accounts was being carried out by Krishna Aiyar and in his subsequent report he pointed out that Rs. 2, 38, 000/- which were shown as having been paid to the Andhra Power System had actually not been paid\tFacts\nIn fact in April, 1952 the Collector attached VESCO properties for realising this amount\tFacts\nOn April 30, 1952 the respondent No. 1, by selling some of his property, himself paid Rs. 50, 000/- to the Andhra Power System towards the sum due to it from VESCO and had promised to pay the balance shortly thereafter\tFacts\nHe was given time for doing so but he failed to pay it\tFacts\nThe Directors of VESCO thereafter authorised K. S. Dutt, one of the Directors to lodge a complaint with the police which he accordingly lodged on May 19, 1952\tFacts\nOn the next day the police placed an armed guard around the office of the respondent No\tFacts\nI and seized a number of papers\tFacts\nAs a result of investigation they found that there was a total misappropriation of Rs\tFacts\n3, 40, 000\tFacts\nOn May 13, 1954 a chargesheet was filed against the two respondents as well as Murti and the approver Ramana\tFacts\nOD September 13, 1954 Ramana offered to make a full Confession to the Additional District Magistrate (Independent) who was empowered to grant pardon under s. 337 of i he Code of Criminal Procedure\tFacts\nHe, however, directed Ramana to make his confession before a SubMagistrate\tFacts\nThe latter accordingly made a confession on November 15, 1954 and on November 17, 1954 the Additional District Magistrate (Independent) granted him pardon and that is how he came to be examined as a witness in this case\tFacts\nAs already stated, the Additional Sessions judge convicted both the respondents, the respondent No\tFacts\nI in respect of each head of the offences with which he was charged and the respondent No. 2 in respect only of the offences of conspiracy and misappropriation\tFacts\nThe High Court set aside the conviction of the respondents on a number of grounds\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn the first place according to the High Court, joint trial of two or more persons in respect of different offences cornmitted by each of them is illegal and that here as they were charged with having committed offences under s. 120-B, s. 409, s. 477-A and s. 476/467, I.P.C\tRuling by Lower Court\nthey could not be tried jointly\tRuling by Lower Court\nAccording to it the provisions of s. 239 were of no avail\tRuling by Lower Court\nNext according to the High Court even if s. 239 is applicable its provisions are subject to those of s. 234 and as such the trial being for more than three offences was impermissible\tRuling by Lower Court\nThen according to the High Court offences under\tRuling by Lower Court\ns. 409 and s\tRuling by Lower Court\n471/467 are of different kinds and are not capable of joint commission\tRuling by Lower Court\nTherefore, they could not be jointly tried\tRuling by Lower Court\nFurther, according to the High Court where a conspiracy has yielded its fruits the conspirators can be charged with the actual offences committed and not with conspiracy to commit those offences\tRuling by Lower Court\nCharge of conspiracy, according to the High Court, can be validly made only when the prosecution establishes that every conspirator expected to receive a personal benefit from it and that the prosecution has not been able to establish that the respondent No. 2 or the approver evidently had any such expectations since they did not in fact receive any corresponding benefit\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn so far as the respondent No. 2 is concerned the High Court has held that since he was charged with a specific offence under s.409 I.P.C. he could not be convicted of mere abetment of an offence\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe approver's evidence was held by the High Court to be inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe High Court has also held that his evidence is unreliable and further that the Additional Sessions judge was in error in allowing him to refresh his memory by referring to various documents in a manner not permitted by s. 159 of the Evidence Act\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe High Court has further stated that inadmissible evidence was taken on record by the Additional Sessions judge, namely, account books of Billimoria Brothers, maintained in Gujrati and further that the Additional Sessions judge was in error in allowing the prosecution to use those account books for establishing absence of entries with regard to certain payments alleged in the VESCO books to have been made to them\tRuling by Lower Court\nFinally, the High Court held that the examination of the respondent under s. 342 of the Code was unfair for a number of reasons and that the Additional Sessions judge had failed to perform an important duty in that he did not call the attention of the respondents to the provisions of s. 342 which enable an accused person to give evidence in his own behalf\tRuling by Lower Court\nMr\tRuling by Lower Court\nBhimasankaram, appearing for the two respondents, however, has not sought to support the judgment of the High Court on all these points\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe points which he urged are briefly these: (1) That there was a misjoinder of charges and persons in that the various provisions of s. 239 were clubbed together and an omnibus charge of conspiracy was framed which on its face was one likely to embarrass the respondents and make their task of defending themselves difficult\tArgument\nThe procedure adopted in the investiga- tion and committal stages was irregular\tArgument\n3) Irrelevant evidence was introduced and some evidence was introduced in a manner not authorised by the Evidence Act\tArgument\n4) That the Court abused its powers under s.342, Cr\tArgument\nP.C. while conducting the examination of the respondents\tArgument\nThe evidence of the approver was inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal, that, in any case, it is unreliable, was so found even by the Sessions judge and must, therefore, be rejected\tArgument\nIf the evidence of the approver is left out the remaining evidence would be inadequate to sustain the prosecution case\tArgument\nWe shall deal with Mr. Bhimasankaram's contentions in the order in which we have set them out\tRatio of the decision\nThe first question for consideration is whether there was a misjoinder of parties and of persons\tRatio of the decision\nThe first charge is in respect of the conspiracy alleged to have been entered into by the two respondents, K. V. Ramana, the approver, and others \"known and unknown\" to commit criminal breach of trust of the funds of VESCO and, in order to screen its detection, to falsify the accounts of VESCO and to use forged documents as genuine\tRatio of the decision\nOn the face of it this is a valid charge\tRatio of the decision\nBut certain objections have been taken to it with which we will deal at the appropriate place\tRatio of the decision\nThe second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under s. 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with Ramana, misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over Rs\tRatio of the decision\n3, 20, 000\tRatio of the decision\nIt is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between April, 1947 and March, 1950, some between April, 1947 and March, 1949, some between April, 1947 and March, 1951 and quite a large number between September, 1947 and March, 1950 and a still large number between April, 1951 and March, 1952\tRatio of the decision\nIt is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period\tRatio of the decision\nUnless, therefore, the provisions of s. 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges\tRatio of the decision\nThe third charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver\tRatio of the decision\nRamana made false entries on seven different dates in the account books between September 19, 1947 and March 18, 1952 and thus committed an offence under s. 477-A, I.P.C\tRatio of the decision\nThe fourth charge is that the two respondents, along with the approver\tRatio of the decision\nRamana forged six documents on different dates between March 28, 1949 and November 12, 1951 and thus committed an offence under s. 471 read with s. 467, I.P.C\tRatio of the decision\nAs we have pointed out earlier the respondent No\tRatio of the decision\nI alone was convicted by the Additional Sessions judge in respect of the third and fourth charges\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Bhimasankaram supports the reason given by the High Court for coming to the conclusion that there was a misjoinder of charges\tRatio of the decision\nThe main reasons upon which the conclusion of the High Court is based are firstly that there could be no clubbing together of the provisions of the various clauses of s. 239 and secondly that the respondents were charged with more than three offences of the same kind and that this was in contravention of s. 239 (c\tRatio of the decision\nIn coming to the conclusion that the provisions of various clauses of s. 239 cannot be applied cumulatively the High Court has relied upon the decision in Re: Vankavalapati Gopala Rao 1956 AIR(Andhra) 21\tPrecedent\nThere the learned judges have held thus: \"These clauses are mutually exclusive and they cannot be simultaneously applied and to construe them as supplementing each other would be enlarging the scope of the exceptions\tPrecedent\nEach clause is an exception to the general rule enacted in s. 233, Cr\tPrecedent\nP.C\tRatio of the decision\nIf such a combination is permissible, all persons accused of offences described in cls\tPrecedent\na) to (g) can be tried together in one case which certainly involves a bewildering multiplicity of charges and which would obviously set at naught the salutary principle contained in s. 233\tPrecedent\nThe chapter is split up into two sub-heads, '-Form of charges\"and\" Joinder of charges\tStatute\nSs\tStatute\n221 to 232 are comprised under the first sub-head and ss\tStatute\n233 to 240 in the second\tStatute\n221 to 223 deal with the framing and content of charge\tStatute\ns. 224 deals with the interpretation of the language of the charge and s. 225 with the effect of errors in the charge\tStatute\n226 to 231 deal with the power of the court with regard to framing and altering charges and the procedure to be adopted at the trial where a charge is found to be defective or there is no charge or where a new charge is to be framed\tStatute\nS. 232 deals with the power of the. appellate court or the High Court when it discovers that there is material error in the charge\tStatute\nThen we come to the other sub-head of this chapter\tStatute\nS. 233 provides that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a. separate charge\tStatute\nIt thus lays down the normal rule to be followed in every case\tStatute\nBut it also provides that this will be subject to the exceptions contained in SS\tStatute\n234, 235, 236 and 239\tStatute\nThe first three provisions relate to the framing of charges against a single accused person\tStatute\nS. 234\tStatute\n1) deals with the trial of a person for offences of the same kind not exceeding three committed within the space of 12 months from the first to the last of such offences and s. 231 (2) what is meant by the expression 'offences of' the same kind\tStatute\nThis provision lifts partially the ban on the trial of a person for more than one offence at the same trial\tStatute\nS. 235(1), however, goes a step further and permits the trial of a person for more offences than one if they are so connected together as to form the same transaction\tStatute\nThus under this provision if the connection between the various offences is established the limitations placed by s. 234(1) both as regards the number and the period during which the offences are alleged to have been committed will not apply\tStatute\nFull effect cannot possibly be given to this provision if we hold that it is subject to the limitation of s.234(1\tStatute\nSub-s\tStatute\n2) of S. 235 deals with a case where an offence falls within two definitions and sub-s.(3) deals with a case in which a number of acts are alleged against an accused person, different com- binations of which may constitute different offences\tStatute\nThen we come to s. 236 which provides that if a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences and further provides that any number of such charges may be tried together\tStatute\nIt also permits that charges could be framed against an accused person in the alternative if the court thinks fit\tStatute\nThus, this is a special provision available in case of doubt and is neither subject to the limitations prescribed by s. 233 nor those of the other preceding provisions\tRatio of the decision\nNow, if the respondent No. 1 were alone tried upon the second, third and the fourth charges the provisions of s. 235(1) could have been pressed in aid if the allegations were that the offences were so connected together as to form one and the same transaction and the validity of the trial would not have been open to any attack\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly if the second respondent were alone tried on the second charge his trial would not have been open to any objection if the allegation were that the offences were so connected together as to form the same transaction\tRatio of the decision\nHere, however, we have a case where the prosecution alleges that there was additionally a conspiracy to which apart from the two respondents the approver and some other persons were parties and where in both the respondents were tried together\tRatio of the decision\nA conspiracy must be regarded as one transaction and, there- fore, a single individual charged with it could be tried with the aid of s. 235(1) for all the acts committed by him in furtherance or in pursuance of the conspiracy without the limitations imposed by s.234(1\tRatio of the decision\nFor, where all the acts are referable to the same conspiracy their connection with one another is obvious\tRatio of the decision\nThe only provision in the Code which permits the joint trial of more than one person is s. 239 and what we have to see is whether under that provision the two respondents could have been jointly tried for the offences with which they were charged\tRatio of the decision\nLet us, therefore, examine closely the provisions of s. 239\tRatio of the decision\nIt will be useful to set out the provisions of that section which run thus :\" \"This first thing to be noticed is that s. 239 does not read as if its various clauses can be applied only alternatively\tStatute\nOn the other hand at the end of cl\tStatute\nf) there is a conjunction 'and\tStatute\nIf the intention of the Legislature was that the provisions of these clauses should be available only alternatively it would have used the word \"or\" and not \"and\" which has the opposite effect\tStatute\nGrammatically, therefore, it would appear that the provisions of the various clauses are capable of being applied cumulatively\tStatute\nThe opening words of the section show that it is an enabling provision and, therefore, the Court has a discretion to avail itself cumulatively of two or more clauses\tStatute\nOf course a Court has the power to depart from the grammatical construction if it finds that strict adherence to the grammatical construction will defeat the object the Legislature had in view\tStatute\nThe concluding portion of s. 239 shows that the provisions contained in the former part of Chapter XIX shall, as far as may be, apply to the charges framed with the aid of s. 239\tStatute\nDoes this mean that the provisions of s. 233, 234, 235, and 236 must also be complied with\tStatute\nObviously, s. 233 does not override the provisions of s. 239\tStatute\nS. 234 cannot also be regarded as an overriding provision because reading it that way will lead to the clear result that whereas several accused persons can be charged at the same trial with any number of different offences committed by them in the course of the same transaction they cannot be tried also for -offences of the same kind exceeding three in number and committed beyond a space of 12 months from the first to the last\tStatute\nIt could not have been the intention of the Legislature to create such a situation\tStatute\nAgain, as already stated, s. 234(1) does not override the provisions of s. 235(1) which permits trial of a person for more offences than one committed during any period provided they are so connected together as to form one transaction\tStatute\nUnless we read s. 234(1) as not enacting a fetter on s. 235(1), it may not be possible to give full effect to the latter\tStatute\nNow, since s. 234(1) cannot be properly read a, , ; overriding s. 235(1) there is no valid reason for construing it as overriding the provisions of s. 239 either\tStatute\nThere are also other reasons which point to this conclusion which we will set out while considering the argument advanced by Mr. Bhimasankaram\tStatute\nBhimasankaram contended that s, 239 must be read at least subject to ss\tStatute\n234(1) and 235(1) on the ground\tStatute\nthat if there are certain restrictions with respect to the trial of a single accused there is no reason why those restrictions will disappear if an accused person is tried along with several other persons\tStatute\nThus he points out that where several persons are accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed by them jointly within a period of 12 months, the number of offences for which they could be tried cannot exceed three\tStatute\nIn this connection he relied upon the words \"within the meaning of s. 224\" occurring in cl\tStatute\nc) of s. 239\tStatute\nThese words, he contended, clearly show that cl\tStatute\nc) of s. 239 is subject to the provisions of s. 234\tStatute\nIn our opinion the words \"within the meaning of s. 234\" indicate that what was meant by the words offence of the same kind\" \"'persons accused of more offences than one of the same kind not exceeding three in number\"or may have used the words\" person accused of more than one offence of the same kind to the extent permissible under s. 234\tStatute\nTherefore, even if the expression \"'same transaction\" alone had been used in s. 235(1) it would have meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connec- ted acts\tRatio of the decision\nThe expression \"same transaction\" occurring in cls\tRatio of the decision\na), (c) and (d) of s. 239 as well as that occurring in s. 235(1) ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes\tRatio of the decision\nLooking at the matter in that way, it is pointless to inquire further whether the provisions of s. 239 are subject to those of s. 236(1\tRatio of the decision\nThe provisions of sub-s\tRatio of the decision\n2) and (3) of s. 235 are enabling provisions and quite plainly can have no overriding effect\tRatio of the decision\nBut it would be open to the court to resort to those provisions even in the case of a joint trial of several persons permissible under s\tRatio of the decision\n239.S. 236\tRatio of the decision\nis also an enabling provision to be availed of in case of doubt and it is meaningless to say that s. 239 is subject to s. 236\tRatio of the decision\nBearing in mind the fact that the provisions in the \"former part\" of Chapter XIX are applicable to charges made with the aid of s. 239 only \"so far as may be\" it would not be right to construe s. 239 as being subject to the provisions of ss\tRatio of the decision\n233 to 236\tRatio of the decision\nIt was contended by Mr. Chari that the expression \"former part\" would apply to the first sub- division of chapter XIX which deals with the form and content of the charges and the powers of the court with regard to the absence of charge and alteration of charge\tRatio of the decision\nWe cannot, however, give the expression such a restricted meaning\tRatio of the decision\nFor, even in the absence of those words, the earlier provisions could not have been ignored\tRatio of the decision\nFor, it is a rule of construction that all the provisions of a statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is, therefore, the duty of the Court to construe a statute harmoniously\tRatio of the decision\nThus, while it is clear that the sections preceding s. 239 have no overriding effect on that section, , the courts are not to ignore them but apply such of them as can be applied without detracting from the provisions of S.239\tRatio of the decision\nIndeed, the very expression 'so far as may be' empha- sises the fact that while the earlier provisions have to be borne in mind by the Court while applying s. 239 it is not those provisions but the latter which is to have an overriding effect\tRatio of the decision\nApart from this, the question whether the provisions of ss\tRatio of the decision\n233 to 236 have or have no overriding effect on s. 239\tRatio of the decision\nis not strictly germane to the question considered by the High Court that is, clubbing together all the provisions of the various clauses of s. 239\tRatio of the decision\nWhether they can or cannot be read cumulatively must be determined by consideration of the language used in those clauses\tRatio of the decision\nWe have already indicated how those clauses may be grammatically read\tRatio of the decision\nOn a plain construction of the provisions of s. 239, therefore, it is open to the Court to avail itself cumulatively of the provisions of the different clauses of s. 239 for the purpose of framing charges and charges so framed by it will not be in violation of the law, the provisions of ss\tRatio of the decision\n233, 234 and 235 notwithstanding\tRatio of the decision\nThe decision of the Allahabad High Court in T. R. Mukherji's case (IL), is directly in point and is clearly to the effect that the different clauses of s. 239 are mutually exclusive in the sense that it is not possible to combine the provisions of two or more clauses in any one case and to try jointly several persons partly by applying the provisions of one clause and partly by applying those of another or other clauses\tRatio of the decision\nA large number of decisions of the different High Courts and one of the Privy Council have been considered in this case\tRatio of the decision\nNo doubt, as has been rightly pointed out in this case, separate trial is the normal rule and joint trial is an exception\tRatio of the decision\nBut while this principle is easy to appreciate and follow where one person alone is the accused and the interaction or intervention of the acts of more persons than one does not come in, it would, where the same act is committed by several persons, be not only inconvenient but injudicious to try all the several persons separately\tRatio of the decision\nThis would lead to unnecessary multiplicity of trials involving avoidable inconvenience to the witnesses and avoidable expenditure of public time and money\tRatio of the decision\nNo corresponding advantage can be gained by the accused persons by following the procedure of separate trials\tRatio of the decision\nWhere, however, several offences are alleged to have been committed by several accused persons it may be more reasonable to follow the normal rule of separate trials\tRatio of the decision\nBut here, again, if those offences are alleged not to be wholly unconnected but as forming part of the same transaction the only consideration that will justify separate trials would be the embarrassment or difficulty caused to the accused persons in defending themselves\tRatio of the decision\nWe entirely agree with the High Court that joint trial should be founded on some 'principle\tRatio of the decision\nBut we find it difficult to appreciate what seems to be the view of the High Court that because each `clause of s. 239 enunciates a separate principle those principles are, so to speak, mutually' exclusive and cannot be cumulatively resorted to for trying several persons jointly in respect of several offences even though they form part of the same transaction\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court has propounded that the connection described in each of the various clauses is mutually exclusive, that no two of them can exist simulta- neously in any case and that one cannot, therefore, have in any case persons connected with one another in two or more ways\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words, as the High Court puts it, persons included in two or more of the groups cannot all be tried together and that since there is absolutely nothing to connect one group with any other, the persons of one group cannot be tried with those of any other\tRatio of the decision\nNo reason has been stated in support of this view\tStatute\nLet us consider whether there is anything intrinsically incompatible in combining two clauses of s. 239\tStatute\nTake cls\tStatute\na) and (b\tStatute\nCl\tRatio of the decision\na) says that persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction may be charged and tried together\tStatute\nb) says that persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment, or, of an attempt to commit such offence may also be charged and tried together\tStatute\nNow, if persons A, B and C are tried for an offence of murder what intrinsic difficulty would there be in trying X, Y and Z of abetment of the same offence\tRatio of the decision\nThe transaction in which all of them have participated is the same and the abetment by X, Y and Z of the offence committed by A, B and C would itself establish the connection of their acts with those of X, Y and Z\tRatio of the decision\nNext, let us take cls\tRatio of the decision\na) and (c\tRatio of the decision\nc) provides that persons accused of more than one offence of the same kind within the meaning of s. 234 committed by them jointly within the period of twelve months could also be charged and tried together\tRatio of the decision\nLet us consider these clauses along with another illustration\tRatio of the decision\nTwo persons A and B enter a house at night and first together commit the murder of a man sleeping there and then also his wife\tRatio of the decision\nEach of them has committed two offences and each of them participated in the same offence\tRatio of the decision\nWhy can they not be tried jointly for both murders and why should there be two trials for the two murders\tRatio of the decision\nThe offences are of the same kind and must be deemed to have been committed in the course of the same transaction because of association and mutual connection\tRatio of the decision\nNow, supposing in the illustration given A killed the man and B killed his wife\tRatio of the decision\nUnder cl\tRatio of the decision\nc) they could be tried together because the offences are of the same kind\tRatio of the decision\nIt would be ridiculous to say that they cannot be tried together for jointly committing the murder of the man and the wife because cl\tRatio of the decision\na) and (c) cannot be combined\tRatio of the decision\nFor, without combining these two clauses their joint trial for the two offences in each of which both have participated would be impermissible\tRatio of the decision\nThen take s. (a) and (d\tRatio of the decision\nd) persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together\tRatio of the decision\nLet us suppose that a group of persons are accused of having been members of an unlawful assembly the common object of which was to overawe by sheer force another group of persons and take forcible possession of a piece of land\tRatio of the decision\nSome of the members of the unlawful assembly carried axes with them while some others carried lathis and attacked the other group\tRatio of the decision\nDuring the course of the attack one person from the second group was killed, as a rest of blows with an axe inflicted by the aggressors A, B and C. Two persons of the second group sustained grievous hurt as a result of lathi blows and one person sustained simple hurt\tRatio of the decision\nLet us say that the grievous hurt was caused as a result of lathi blows given by X and Y, simple hurt was caused by lathi blows given by Z\tRatio of the decision\nHere, the offences committed were those under ss\tRatio of the decision\n147, 302, 325 and 323, I.P.C\tRatio of the decision\nThe offences being different and the persons commiting the offences being different, they could not be tried jointly only with the help of cl\tRatio of the decision\na) of s. 239\tRatio of the decision\nNor again, could they be tried jointly only with the help of cl\tRatio of the decision\nd\tRatio of the decision\nYet the transaction in which the offences were committed is the same and there is a close association amongst the persons who have committed the different offences\tRatio of the decision\nWhat intrinsic difficulty is there in trying them all together simultaneously availing of cls\tRatio of the decision\na) and (d) of s. 239\tRatio of the decision\nThese are enabling provisions which circumstance implies that the court may avail itself of one or more of these provisions unless doing so would amount to an infringement of any of the provisions of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nAll these persons can be jointly tried for offences under s. 147 by recourse to cl\tRatio of the decision\na\tRatio of the decision\nSo also A, B and C could be jointly tried together for an offences under s. 302\tRatio of the decision\nX and Y can be charged not only with offences under ss\tRatio of the decision\n147 and 325, I. P.C. but also under s\tRatio of the decision\n302 read with s. 149\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly Z can be charged with offence's under ss\tRatio of the decision\n147, 323 and offences under s. 302\tRatio of the decision\nread with s. 149 and s. 325\tRatio of the decision\nread with s. 149\tRatio of the decision\nThe same offence committed by all of them is that under s. 147 and all of them can be tried jointly in respect of that offence under cl\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly, if we take cl\tRatio of the decision\nd) by itself all of them can be tried jointly for the different offences committed by each of them in the course of the same transaction and if cl\tRatio of the decision\na) is unavailable they could not be tried for the offence under s. 147 at the same trial\tRatio of the decision\nThis means that the trial for an offence under s. 147 will have to be separated from the trial for the different offences committed by them\tRatio of the decision\nIt is difficult to appreciate what purpose would be served by separating the trial for the same offence from the trial for different offences\tRatio of the decision\nTo repeat, the object of the legislature in enacting s. 239, Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. clearly was to prevent multiplicity of trials and not only would that object be defeated but an extraordinary result will ensue if the various clauses of s. 239 are read disjunctively\tRatio of the decision\nThe reasons given by the Allahabad High Court, therefore, do not merit acceptance\tRatio of the decision\nThe decision in Singarachariar's Case 1934 Indlaw MAD 352\tRatio of the decision\nC.), has really no bearing upon the point before us\tRatio of the decision\nWhat was held there was that ss\tRatio of the decision\n235 (1) and s. 236 are mutually exclusive and if a case is covered by one of them it cannot be covered by the other\tRatio of the decision\nIn that case the question was whether a person who was first tried for an offence under s. 380, I.P.C. for stealing a blank second class railway ticket from the booking office, tried, for it and acquitted, could not be tried subsequently for the offence of forgery by making entries in that ticket and using it\tRatio of the decision\nThe acquittal in the previous case was urged as a bar under s. 403(1) of the Code to the trial for an offence under s. 467, I.P.C\tRatio of the decision\nThe contention apparently was that this was a case which fell under s. 236, Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. and that if he had been tried alternatively for both the offences at the same trial the Court could have dealt with him under s. 237, Cr\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court, however, held that to be a kind of case which fell under s. 235(1) of the Code and that since that was so, the provisions of s. 236 were excluded\tRatio of the decision\nIt is difficult to appreciate how this case assists the conclusion arrived at by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn D.K. Chandra's Case 1951 Indlaw MUM 117, F. B) it was held that the provisions of ss\tRatio of the decision\n234, 235 and 236\tRatio of the decision\nbeing exceptions to s. 233 must be strictly construed and that if joinder of charges did not fall under any of them it would be illegal and contrary to law\tRatio of the decision\nThe precise point which we have to consider here did not fall for consideration in that case i.e., whether the provisions of the various clauses of s. 239 could be used together or not\tRatio of the decision\nThis decision is, therefore, of little assistance\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other band there is the decision of this Court in The State of Andhra Pradesh v. Kandinmlla Subbaiah , which is to the effect that where several persons had committed offences in the course of the same transactions, they could jointly be tried in respect of all those offences under s. 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the limitation placed by s. 234 of the Code could not come into operation\tRatio of the decision\nThere, nine persons were jointly tried for 'an offence under s. 5 (1) (c) and (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, and s. 109, I. P. C. read with s' 420, s. 466 and s. 467, I. P.

Krishna Murthy Iyer v. The State of Madras (IN on which Mr. Bhimasankaram strongly relied\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn that case this Court upheld the order of the High Court of Madras in quashing the charges in the exercise of its inherent powers even before the conclusion of the trial\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt is true that there the charges were 67 in number and spread over a long period, of time\tRuling by Lower Court\nThat again was a matter which came before the High Court before conviction and not after the trial was over\tRuling by Lower Court\nWhen an objection is taken at an early stage, there is time enough to rectify an error\tRuling by Lower Court\nBut in the case before us no objection was taken to multiplicity or misjoinder of charges before the learned Additional Sessions judge and it was only in the High Court that the point was raised\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn such circumstances what the Court has to consider is whether prejudice has in fact been caused to the accused by reason of the multiplicity of charges or misjoinder, if any, of the charges\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis is quite clear from the provisions of s. 537 of the Code as amended by Act 26 of 1955\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn Willie (William) Slaney v. The State of Madhya Pradesh , all the learned judges were in agreement on the point that this section and s. 535 cover every case in which there is departure from the rules set out in Ch\tRuling by Lower Court\nXIX ranging from error, omissions and irregularities in charges that are framed, down to charges that might have been framed and were not and include a total omission to frame a charge at all at any stage of the trial\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe whole question has again been examined by this Court recently in Birichh Bhuian v. The State of Bihar Subba Rao J., who delivered the judgment of the Court has stated the position thus \"Even if we were to assume that there has been a misjoinder of charges in violation of the provisions of ss\tRuling by Lower Court\n233 to 239 of the Code, the High Court was incompetent to set aside the conviction of the respondents without coming to the definite conclusion that misjoinder had occasioned failure of justice\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis decision completely meets the argument based upon Dawson's Case\tRuling by Lower Court\nMerely because the accused persons are charged with a large number of offences and convicted at the trial the conviction cannot be set aside by the appellate court unless it in fact came to the conclusion that the accused persons were embarrassed in their defence with the result that there was a failure of injustice\tRuling by Lower Court\nFor all these reasons we cannot accept the argument of learned counsel on the ground of misjoinder of charges and multiplicity of charges\tRuling by Lower Court\nBhimasankaram, supporting the view taken by the High Court then contends that it is not permissible to frame a charge of conspiracy when the matter has proceeded beyond the stage of conspiracy and that in pursuance of it offences have actually been committed\tRuling by Lower Court\nA similar view was expressed by the same High Court in the case which was reversed by this Court in The State of Andhra Pradesh V. Kandinalla Subbaiah ( 1962 (2) SCR 194, ), and it was held that conspiracy to commit an offence being itself an offence a person can be separately charged with respect to such a conspiracy\tRuling by Lower Court\nThen this Court has observed\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis decision is sufficient to dispose of the point under consideration\tRatio of the decision\nIn Swamirathnam's case (1), which is a decision of this Court certain persons were tried for the offence of the conspiracy to cheat the members of the public and for specific offences of cheating in pursuance of that conspiracy\tPrecedent\nIt was urged before this Court that there was misjoinder of charges and persons\tPrecedent\nNegativing the contention\tPrecedent\nthis Court held that the charge as framed disclosed a single conspiracy although spread over several years, that there was one object of the conspiracy and that was to cheat the members of the public, that the fact that in the course of years other joined the conspiracy or that several incidents of cheating took place in pursuance of the conspiracy did not have the effect of splitting the conspiracy into several conspiracies\tPrecedent\nthat the several instances of cheating being alleged to be in pursuance of that conspiracy were parts of the same transaction and, therefore, the joint trial of the accused persons for the different offences was not vitiated\tPrecedent\nNo doubt, there is no discussion there as to the question whether the various clauses of s. 239 could be combined or as to the impact of the provisions of S. 233 to 236 on those of s. 239\tRatio of the decision\nThe actual decision of the case is, however, directly opposed to the contention now put forward before us\tRatio of the decision\nThis decision has been followed in Natwarlal Sakarlal\tRatio of the decision\nMody v.

Dawson ( [1960] 2 W.L.R. 435, contended that in any event it was not desirable to try the respondents at the same trial for as many as 83 offences and pointed out that these observations had received the approval of this Court in The State of Andhra Pradesh v. Kandimalla Subbaiah ([1962] 2 B. C.R. 194\tArgument\nIn the first place there the trial had not actually begun\tArgument\nAgain, what was said by this Court was that it is undesirable to complicate a trial by introducing a large number of charges spread over a long period but even so this was a question of propriety which should be left to the discretion of the judge or Magistrate trying the case\tArgument\nObjection was taken very seriously by Mr. Bhimasankaram to the charge of conspiracy framed in this case\tArgument\nThat charge reads thus :\" \"Adverting to the portion which we have bracketed, his first objection was that the charge comprises within it not merely the conspiracy but also what was in fact done in pursuance of the conspiracy\tArgument\nHis next objection was that it brought within its purview all the various offences which were alleged to have been committed by the respondents\tArgument\nThe third objection was that no charge of conspiracy could have been framed after the conspiracy had borne its fruits\tArgument\nThe last objection was that the charge of conspiracy was added to the charge sheet very late\tArgument\nWe shall first deal with the third point\tArgument\nThe offence of conspiracy is an entirely independent offence and though other offences are committed in pursuance of the conspiracy the liability of the conspirators for the conspiracy itself cannot disappear\tArgument\nIn the Indian Penal Code, as originally enacted, conspiracy was not an offence\tArgument\nS. 120 -B which makes criminal conspiracy punishable was added by the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1913 (8 of 1913) along with s. 120-A. Section 120-A defines conspiracy and s. 120- B provides for the punishment for the offence of conspiracy\tArgument\nCriminal conspiracy as defined in s. 120-A and consists of an agreement to do an illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is not illegal by illegal means\tRatio of the decision\nS. 120 B provides that whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as if he has abetted such offence unless there was an express provision in the Code for the punishment of such conspiracy\tRatio of the decision\nCriminal conspiracy was, however, not an unknown thing before the amendment of the Indian Penal Code in 1913\tRatio of the decision\nBut what the amendment did was to make that conspiracy itself punishable\tRatio of the decision\nThe idea was to prevent the commission of crimes by, so to , speak, nipping them in the bud\tRatio of the decision\nBut it does not follow that where crimes have been committed the liability to punishment already incurred under s. 120-B by having entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby wiped away\tRatio of the decision\nNo doubt, as already stated, where offences for committing which a conspiracy was entered into have actually been committed it may not, in the particular circumstances of a case, be desirable to charge the offender both with the conspiracy and the offences committed in pursuance of that conspiracy\tRatio of the decision\nBut that would be a matter ultimately within the discretion of the court before which the trial takes place\tRatio of the decision\nIn so far as the fourth point is concerned, that would have a bearing not on the form of the charge but on the credibility of the evidence bearing on the point of conspiracy\tRatio of the decision\nAs we are remanding the appeal to the High Court for a fresh decision after full consideration of the evidence adduced in the case it would be open to it to consider this matter particularly while judging the credibility of the-evidence of the approver\tRatio of the decision\nIn so far as the portion included in the bracket is concerned we agree with the learned counsel that it should not have found place there\tRatio of the decision\nThe ideas, however, of the committing magistrate in stating all that is said there appears to have been merely to describe the conspiracy and do nothing more\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not think that either that or the other objection raised, that is, that the charge embraces within it all the offences said to have been committed by the respondents can properly\tRatio of the decision\nbe said to vitiate the charge\tRatio of the decision\nThe object in saying what has been set out in the first charge was only to give notice to the respondents as to the ambit of the conspiracy to which they will have to answer and nothing more\tRatio of the decision\nEven assuming for a moment that this charge is cumbersome in the absence of any objection by the respondents at the proper time and in the absence of any material from which we could infer prejudice, they are precluded by the provisions of s. 225 from complaining about it at any rate after their conviction by the trial court\tRatio of the decision\nComing to the next point of Mr\tRatio of the decision\nBhimsankaram regarding the abuse of powers under s. 342 his first contention was that long and involved questions were put to the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nHis second contention was that reference was made to a number of documents in some of these questions and those documents were not made available to the respondents for answering those questions\tArgument\nThe third contention was that the questions were involved, confusing and bordered on cross-examination\tArgument\nFinally he said that the court did not perform its duty under s. 342 (4) of the Code as amended as it failed to bring to the notice of the respondents that they may, if they chose, give evidence in their defence\tArgument\nIn support of his first contention he referred to questions Nos\tArgument\n4, 8, 9, 10 and 20 put to the respondent No\tArgument\nI and question No. 12 put to the respondent No. 2 and tried to show that those questions rolled up a large number of separate questions and that it could not have been possible for the respondents to give any rational answers to those questions\tArgument\nWe have read the questions and so also the answers\tArgument\nWhile we are disposed to agree with learned counsel that the questions embrace a number of matters and that it would have been better if those matters had been made the subjects of separate questions, the answers given by the respondents clearly show that they understood the questions and wherever possible they have given complete answers to those questions\tArgument\nThat is to say, they have given their explantion regarding the circumstances appearing in the evidence set out in the questions and wherever that was not feasible they have said that they would do so in their written statements\tArgument\nIn fact written statements have been filed by each of them in which every point left over has been fully answered\tRatio of the decision\nWe are informed that the questions had been prepared before hand by the learned Additional Sessions judge, copies thereof were made available to each of the respondents and it was with reference to those copies that they gave their answers in the court\tRatio of the decision\nA pointed reference was made to question\tRatio of the decision\nNo. 20 put to respondent\tRatio of the decision\nNo\tRatio of the decision\nI which contains as many as 22 sub-heads and it is said that it was an extremely unfair and embarrassing question\tRatio of the decision\nWhat the learned Additional Sessions judge has done is to err on the side of over-cautiousness by putting every circumstance appearing in the evidence to the respondents for eliciting their explanations\tRatio of the decision\nHis object was to obviate the possibility of a complaint before the appellate court that they were denied the opportunity of explaining the circumstances appearing in evidence against them because of defective questions\tRatio of the decision\nNor again, do we think that there is any substance in the complaint made that the respondents had no opportunity of referring to the documents to which reference has been made in certain questions\tRatio of the decision\nNo objection was taken on their behalf before the learned Additional Sessions judge and from the manner in which they have answered the questions there is no doubt that they must have had opportunity to look at the relevant documents and answer the questions\tRatio of the decision\nWe are also satisfied that there is no substance in the complaint that the questioning bordered on cross-examination\tRatio of the decision\nUndoubtedly the learned Additional Sessions judge has questioned the respondents very fully and elaborately but to say that this bordered on cross- examination is wholly unjustifiable\tRatio of the decision\nThe object of the learned Additional Sessions Judge quite clearly was, as already stated, to leave no loophole for a complaint to be made before the appellate court of incomplete or insufficient examination under s. 342.Finally we are clear that it was not the duty of the court to draw the pointed attention of the respondents to the provisions of sub-s\tRatio of the decision\n4) of s. 342 and tell them that they may, if they chose, enter the witness box\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that by introducing this provision the disability placed on an accused person in respect of giving evidence on oath in his own defence has been removed and to that extent such person is placed on par with an accused person under the English law\tRatio of the decision\nThe new provision, however, does no more than lift the ban and does not impose a duty on the court to draw the attention of an accused person to its contents\tRatio of the decision\nApart from that, the respondents were represented by counsel at the trial who knew very well what the law was\tRatio of the decision\nNo complaint was made by the respondents even in appeal that they were ignorant of their right, that had they known about it they would have given evidence on oath in their defence and that because of this they have been prejudiced\tRatio of the decision\nIn the circumstances this point must also be rejected as being without substance\tRatio of the decision\nThe irrelevant evidence to which Mr. Bhimasankaram referred was certain account books\tRatio of the decision\nThe entries in the. account books of VESCO show that certain sums of money were paid to various parties, Crompton Engineering Co., Lumin Electric Co., D. Brothers, Radio and Electrical, Madras, Vizagapatam Municipality, P. V. Ramanayya Bros., and Andhra Power System\tRatio of the decision\nThey also show payment case was that the payments which were entered in the account of VESCO do not find a place in the account books of the corresponding firms or authorities because they were never made by VESCO\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court has pointed out that the main evidence on which the prosecution rests its case that the amount represented by the entries against these various firms were in\tRatio of the decision\nfact misappropriated by the, respondents in the circumstance that there are no corresponding entries in the account books of those firms\tRatio of the decision\nThe argument before the High Court was and before us is that, the absence of an entry cannot of electricity duty to Government\tRatio of the decision\nThe prosecution be established by reference to s. 34 of the Indian Evidence Act which reads thus\tRatio of the decision\nWhat it does is to make entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business relevant in all proceedings in a court of law\tRatio of the decision\nThese entries are, however, not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, when A sues B for a sum of money it is open to him to put his account books' in evidence provided they are regularly kept in the course of business and show by reference to them that the amount claimed by him is debited against B\tRatio of the decision\nThe entry though made by A in his own account books, and though it is in his own favour is a piece of evidence which the court may take into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the amount referred to therein was in fact paid by A to B\tRatio of the decision\nThe entry by itself is of no help to A in his claim against B but it can be considered by the court along with the evidence of A for drawing the conclusion that the amount was paid by A to B\tRatio of the decision\nTo this limited extent entries -in the account books are relevant and can be proved\tRatio of the decision\nS. 34 does not go beyond that\tRatio of the decision\nIt says nothing about non-existence of entries in account books\tRatio of the decision\nWe, therefore, agree with the High Court that the account books of the various concerns to whom payments are said to have been made by the respondents are not by themselves evidence of the fact that no payments were received by them\tRatio of the decision\nThe decision in Queen Empress v. Grees Chunder Banerjee ((1884) I. L. R. 10\tRatio of the decision\nCal 1024.), upon which reliance is placed by the High Court in support of its view is also to that effect\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly in Ram prashad Singh v. Lakhpati Koer ((1902) I. L. R. 30\tRatio of the decision\nCal 231, 247\tRatio of the decision\nLord Robertson during the course of the hearing has observed that no inference can be drawn from the absence of any entry relating to any particular matter which observation supports the view taken in Queen Empress v. Girish Chander Banerjee ( (1884) I.L.R. 10 C.L 1024\tRatio of the decision\nThat , however, is not the Only provision to be Considered\tRatio of the decision\nThere is s. II of the Evidence Act which provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact\tRatio of the decision\nSome of the facts in issue in this case are whether payments of certain sums of money were made to Crompton Engineering Co., and other firms or authorities\tRatio of the decision\nThese are relevant facts\tRatio of the decision\nAbsence of entries in their account books would be inconsistent with the receipt of the accounts and would thus be a relevant fact which can be proved under s. 11\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that no payments were received by those firms has been deposed to by persons connected with those firms and whose duty it was to receive and acknowledge amounts received by the firms or who were in charge of the accounts of these firms\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of showing that no amounts were received by the firms, their account books would thus be as relevant as the VESCO account books for the purpose of showing the contrary\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly there is s. 5 of the Evidence Act which reads thus:\" \"It is the case of the prosecution that the alleged payments were never made by VESCO to the various firms\tStatute\nIt is also their case that these firms maintain their accounts in the regular course of business and it is their practice to enter in those accounts all payments received by them\tStatute\nBoth the sets of facts are relevant, that is, non-receipt of the amounts by the firms and non-existence of entries in their account books pertaining to those amounts\tStatute\nIt is permissible, therefore, for the prosecution to lead evidence to , Drove both these facts\tStatute\nThe best evidence to prove the latter set of facts consists of the account books of the firms themselves\tStatute\nIt is under these provisions that the account books of the firms must be held to be relevant\tStatute\nWhat value to attach to them is another matter and would be for the Court of fact to consider\tStatute\nIt may further - be mentioned that the account books of VESCO show certain payments made to Billimoria & Co. of Kharagpur\tStatute\nPapers seized by the police include receipts purporting to have been signed by one J. J. Billimoria on behalf of the firm\tStatute\nThe prosecution case is that these receipts are forged documents and the entries in the account books of VESCO are false\tStatute\nOne of the partners of the firm was examined by the prosecution as a witness in the case and he produced the account books of the firm\tStatute\nThose account books are in Gujrati and he stated in his evidence that the accounts were regularly kept and that there were no entries in them corresponding to the entries in the VESCO accounts\tStatute\nThe High Court held that since the account books were not translated they are not admissible in evidence\tStatute\nThe High Court was clearly wrong in so holding\tStatute\nIn coming to this conclusion it has relied upon the provisions of s. 356 (2A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure\tStatute\nThat section reads thus:\" \"This provision relates only to the oral evidence adduced in a case and not to documentary evidence\tStatute\nMr. Bhimasankaram, therefore, very rightly did not support the view of the High Court\tStatute\nIn the circumstances we wish to say nothing further on the point\tStatute\nWe may, however, point out that Billimoria himself gave his evidence in English\tStatute\nAnother point urged by Mr. Bhimasankaram was that as many as 2, 000 documents were \"dumped\" by the prosecution in this case out of which 1600 documents were not sought to be proved by it\tArgument\nFurther, 64 documents were missing from the records when they came to the High Court and that this has caused serious prejudice to the respondent\tArgument\nNo objection, however, was taken in the courts below on this score and in the absence of any prejudice to the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nwe do not think that we should take notice of the complaint made by Mr. Bhimasankaram\tRatio of the decision\nThe third point stressed by him was that the approver was allowed to refresh his memory, while deposing in the case, by referring extensively to the account books and various documents produced in the case\tRatio of the decision\nThis, according to him, was an absue of the provisions of s. 159 of the Evidence Act\tRatio of the decision\nNow, s. 159 expressly enables a witness while under examination to refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is being questioned or soon afterwards, or to a writing made -similarly by another person and read by the witness immediately or soon after the writing was made\tRatio of the decision\nS. 160 provides that a witness may also testify to the facts mentioned in any such document as is mentioned in s. 159\tRatio of the decision\nThe complaint of Mr. Bhimasankaram is that the approver should have been questioned about the various facts which were sought to be established through his evidence and it was only if and when he was in a difficulty that he should have been allowed to refer to the account books\tRatio of the decision\nInstead of doing that what he was permitted to do was just to prove the various documents or read those documents and then depose with reference to them\tRatio of the decision\nIn our opinion, where a witness has to depose to a large number of transactions , and those transactions referred to are or mentioned either in the account books or in other documents there is nothing wrong in allowing the witness to refer to the account books and the documents while answering the questions put to him in his examination\tRatio of the decision\nHe cannot be expected to remember every transaction in all its details and s. 160 specifically permits a witness to testify the facts mentioned in the documents referred to in s. 159 although he has no recollection of the facts themselves if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document\tRatio of the decision\nThat is precisely what happened in this case and we do not think that the Additional Sessions judge adopted a procedure which was either a violation of law or was an abuse of the power of the Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe next point is a formidable one\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to Mr. Bhimasankaram, the pardon tendered to the approver was illegal and if the pardon is illegal his evidence is wholly inadmissible\tRatio of the decision\nFurther, according to him, the evidence of the approver was found by the Additional Sessions judge to be unreliable and therefore, the first condition referred to in Sarwan Singh v. The State of Punjab , was not satisfied\tRatio of the decision\nFor all these reasons the evidence of the approver must be left out of account\tRatio of the decision\nIf it is left out of account, he contends, there is nothing left in the prose- cution case, because, as pointed out by the Additional Sessions judge himself the evidence of the approver is the pivot of the prosecution case\tRatio of the decision\nThe pardon is stated to be illegal for two reasons\tRatio of the decision\nThe first reason is that none of the offences alleged to have been committed falls within s. 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the second reason is that the pardon was granted by an authority not empowered to grant it\tRatio of the decision\nS. 337 (1) as it stood before its amendment by Act 26 of 1955 read thus\tRatio of the decision\nHis contention is that where none of the offences is exclusively triable by the High Court or the Court of Sessions pardon could be granted only if the offences are punishable with imprisonment which could extend to ten years but not if a higher punishment were provided for them\tArgument\nHere, one of the offences alleged against the respondents is criminal breach of trust punishable under s. 409, I.P.C\tArgument\nIt is not exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions and the punishment as set out in the 7th column of Schedule II, Cr\tArgument\nP. C. was transportation for life or imprisonment of either description for ten years and fine\tArgument\nHe contends that since the offence is punishable with transportation for life, s. 337 (1) could not be availed of for granting pardon to the approver\tArgument\nIt seems to us that it would not be correct to read s. 337 (1) in the way sought by learned counsel\tArgument\nThe very object of this provision is to allow pardon to be tendered in cases where a grave offence is alleged to have been committed by several persons so that with the aid of the evidence of the person pardoned the offence could be brought home to the rest\tArgument\nThe gravity is of course to be determined with reference to the sentence awardable with respect to that offence\tArgument\nOn the strength of these considerations Mr. Chari for the State contends that if the words \"any offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to 10 years\" were interpreted to mean offences which were punishable with imprinsonment of less than 10 years grave offences which are not exclusively triable by a court of Sessions will be completely out of s. 337 (1\tArgument\nHe suggests that this provision can also be reasonably interpreted to mean that where the offences are punishable with imprisonment exceeding 10 years pardon may be granted to the approver\tArgument\nNo doubt, if this interpretation is accepted the object of the section, that is, to embrace within it the graver offences, would be fulfilled, but we wish to express no opinion on it\tRatio of the decision\nFor, the pardon granted in -this case can be regarded as being within the ambit of s. 337 (1) for another reason\tRatio of the decision\nIt will be noticed that transportation for life was not the only punishment provided for an offence under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code even before the amendment made to the Indian Penal Code by s. 117 of the Act 26 of 1955, the other alternative being imprisonment up to 10 years\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, since the offence under s. 409 was not merely punishable with transportation for life but alternately also punishable with imprisonment which could extend to 10 years, s. 337 (1) would apply\tRatio of the decision\nThis section does not expressly say that the only punishment provided for the offence should be imprisonment not exceeding 10 years\tRatio of the decision\nThe reason why two alternative maximum sentences are given in col\tRatio of the decision\n7, that is, transportation for life (now imprisonment for life) and imprisonment not exceeding 10 years appears to be that the offence is not exclusively triable by a court of session and could also be tried by a Magistrate, who, except when empowered under s. 30 would be incompetent to try offences punishable with transportation for life (now imprisonment for life) and the further reason that it should be open to the court of Session, instead of awarding the sentence of transportation for life to a convicted person to award him imprisonment in a jail in India itself for a period not execeeding 10 years\tRatio of the decision\nNow, of course, by the amendment made by s. 117 of Act 26 of 1955 for the words \"transportation for life\" the words \"imprisonment for life\" have been substituted, but the original structure of all the sections now amended continues\tRatio of the decision\nThat is why they read rather queer but even so they serve the purpose of allowing certain offences triable by a court of Session, to be triable also by Magistrates of the First Class\tRatio of the decision\nBe that as it may, there is no substance in the first ground\tRatio of the decision\nWhat we have said about pardon in respect of an offence under s. 409 would apply equally to that for one under s. 120-B because the punishment for it is the same as that for the offence under s. 409\tRatio of the decision\nThe offence under s. 467 read with s. 471 is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a period of 10 years but it is exclusively triable by a court of Session and, therefore, in so far as such offence is concerned the argument of Mr. Bhimasankaram would not even have been available\tRatio of the decision\nAs regards the offence under s. 477-A, it is one of those sections which are specifically enumerated in s. 337 (1) and the argument advanced before us-and which we have rejected would not even be available with regard to the pardon in respect of that offence\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that the respondent No\tRatio of the decision\nI alone was convicted by the Additional Sessions judge of this offence and the offence under s. 467 read with s. 471 but the validity of a pardon is to be determined with reference to the offence alleged against the approver alone and not with reference to the offence or offences for which his associates were ultimately convicted\tRatio of the decision\nComing to the next ground of attack on the validity of pardon, the argument of Mr. Bhimasankaram is that whereas s. 337 (1) speaks of pardon being granted by a District Magistrate, or Presidency Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any Magistrate of First Class, except in cases where an enquiry or trial was pending before another Magis- tratc, the pardon here was granted by the Additional District Magistrate in a case where an enquiry was pending before the District Magistrate and is, therefore, illegal and of no avail\tArgument\nHe contends that s. 337 (1) speaks of the District Magistrate which expression does not include an Additional District Magistrate\tArgument\nMr. Bhimasankaram's argument on the point may be summarised thus : Such a power cannot be conferred upon an Additional District Magistrate because s. 337 (1) does not contemplate grant of pardon by an Additional District Magistrate and that the Additional District Magistrate would have no status other than that of a Magistrate, First Class\tRatio of the decision\nNo doubt, under entry (9-a) in Part III of Sch\tRatio of the decision\nIII to the Code a Magistrate, First Class, has the power to grant pardon under s. 337 but it is limited by the proviso thereto to certain classes of cases\tRatio of the decision\nA case under enquiry or trial before another magistrate does not fall in any of these classes\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, a pardon granted by him in such a case would be illegal\tRatio of the decision\nThe Magistrate before whom the enquiry or trial is proceeding or the District Magistrate would be the only authorities competent to grant a pardon in such a case\tRatio of the decision\nAlternatively, the State Government has not made any directions under sub-s\tRatio of the decision\n2) of s. 10 specifying the powers of the District Magistrate which would lie exercisable by the Additional District Magistrate concerned\tRatio of the decision\nIn order to appreciate and consider the argument it is desirable to bear in mind the changes in the magisterial set up in the former province of Madras which comprised within it the district of Visakhapatnam\tRatio of the decision\nBy Government Order No. 3106 dated September 9, 1949 the Government of the Province of Madras issued certain instructions to the Magistrates in pursuance of the separation of the judiciary from the executive\tRatio of the decision\nIt divided the magistrates into two groups, Judicial magistrates and executive magistrates\tRatio of the decision\nThe latter category comprises of the executive officers of the Revenue Department, on whom the responsibility for the maintenance of law and order was to continue to rest\tRatio of the decision\nPara 4 of the instructions provides\tRatio of the decision\nPara 5 provides that as officers of the Revenue Department, those magistrates would be under the control of the Government through the Board of Revenue\tRatio of the decision\nThe Additional District Magistrates (Independent) would also be under the control of the Government through the Board of Revenue\tRatio of the decision\nThe category of judicial Magistrates was constituted of the following: (1) District Magistrate; (2) Sub-divisional Magistrates; (3) Additional First Class Magistrates and (4) Second Class Magistrates (Sub- magistrates\tRatio of the decision\nThe District Magistrate was constituted as the principal magistrate of the District and as such was entrusted with the duty of general administration and superintendence and control over the other judicial magis- trates in the district\tRatio of the decision\nIn addition to his general supervisory functions and the special powers under the Code of hearing revision petitions, transfer petitions, appeals from Second Class Magistrates and the like, the District Magistrate was also to be assigned a specific area, the cases arising from which would be disposed of normally by himself\tRatio of the decision\nThis body of magistrates was made subordinate to the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nTill the separation between the judiciary and the executive was effected the Collector as the head of the Revenue Department was also the District Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nConsequent on the separation\tRatio of the decision\nhe became only an Additional District Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nPart IV of the Government order deals with the allocation of powers between the judicial and executive magistrates\tRatio of the decision\nPara 19(3) occurring in this part deals with allocation of powers under the provisions of the Code otherwise than these referred to in the earlier paragraphs\tRatio of the decision\nIt specifically provides that the power to tender pardon udder s. 337 shall be exercised by executive magistrates except in cases referred to in the proviso to sub-s\tRatio of the decision\n1) of that section, in which case a judicial magistrate may exercise that power\tRatio of the decision\nIn spite of the Government order all Magistrates who have, under Sch\tRatio of the decision\nIII to the Code of Criminal procedure the power to grant pardon will continue to have that power and, therefore, a pardon granted by a judicial Magistrate in contravention of the Government order will not be rendered invalid\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, that is not the point which is relevant while considering the argument of Mr. Bhimasankaram\tRatio of the decision\nHis point is that the proviso to s. 337(1) confers the power on \"the District Magistrate\" to grant pardon in a case pending before another Magistrate and not on \"a District Magistrate\" and, therefore, his power to grant pardon in such cases cannot be conferred under sub-s.(2) of s. 10 on an Additional District Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to him, under that section only the powers of \"a District Magistrate\" meaning thereby only the powers under Entry 7 (a) in Part V of Sch\tRatio of the decision\nIII\tRatio of the decision\nas distinguished from the power under the proviso to s. 337 (1) can be conferred upon an Additional District Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly, according to him, no direction has in fact been shown to have been made by the State Government conferring upon an Additional District Magistrate the power of the District Magistrate to grant pardon\tRatio of the decision\nIn our opinion, there is no subtance in the contention\tRatio of the decision\nThe power conferred by sub-s\tRatio of the decision\n1) of s. 337 on the different clauses of Magistrates is of the same character\tRatio of the decision\nThe power to grant pardon in a case pending before another Magistrate is no doubt conferred by the proviso only on the District Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nBut Entry 7 (a) in Part V of Sch\tRatio of the decision\nIII when it refers to the power of a District Magistrate under s. 337 (1) does not exclude the power under the proviso\tRatio of the decision\nThere is, therefore, no warrant for drawing a distinction between the powers of \"the District Magistrate\" and the powers of \"'a District Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nThe power of a District Magistrate to grant Pardon has been specifically conferred on Additional District Magistrates as would appear from s\tRatio of the decision\nno\tRatio of the decision\n37 of Sch\tRatio of the decision\nIII of the Government Order, which reads thus\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Chari for the State advanced a further argument before us in case his main argument that the pardon was valid failed and said that the approver, even if we ignore the pardon, was a competent witness\tArgument\nIn support of his contention he strongly relied upon the decision in Kandaswamy Gounder\tArgument\nIn re : the appellant (I.L.R. 1957 Mad 715 ), and the cases referred to therein, in particular the decision in Winson v. Queen ((1866) L.R. I Q.B\tArgument\nWhat has been held in all these cases is that where the trial of a person who was charged with having committed an offence or offences jointly with several persons is separated from the trial of those persons, he would be a competent witness against them though of course there will always be the question as to what weight should be attached to his evidence\tArgument\nMr. Chari then referred to s. 133 of the Evidence Act and pointed out that this section clearly makes an accomplice evidence admissible in a case and that an approver whose pardon is found to be invalid does not cease to be an accomplice and contends that he is, therefore, as competent a witness as he would have been if he had not been granted pardon at all and not been put on trial\tArgument\nLearned counsel further pointed out that the decisions show that however undesirable it may be to adduce the evidence of a person jointly accused of having committed an offence along with others, his evidence is competent and admissible except when it is given in a case in which he is being actually tried\tArgument\nThis legal position does not, according to him, offend the guarantee against testimonial compulsion and he points out that that is the reason why an accused person is not to be administered an oath when the court examines him under s. 342 (1) for enabling him to explain the circumstances appearing in evidence against him\tArgument\nIf pardon is tendered to an accused person and eventually it is found that the pardon is illegal such person is pushed back into the rank of an accused person and being no more than an accomplice would be a competent witness\tArgument\nThe question raised is an important one and requires a serious consideration\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Chari in support of his contention has cited a large number of cases, Indian as well as English, and certain passages from Halsbury's Laws of England\tRatio of the decision\nBut in the view we take about the legal validity of the pardon tendered, we do not wish to pronounce one way or the other on this very interesting question\tRatio of the decision\nNow, as regards the reliability of the approver\tRatio of the decision\nIt is no doubt true that an approver has always been regarded as an infamous witness, who, on his own showing has participated in a crime or crimes and later to save his own skin, turned against his former associates and agreed to give evidence against them in the hope that he will be pardoned for the offence committed by him\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court seems to think that before reliance could be placed upon the evidence of the approver it must appear that he is a penitent witness\tRatio of the decision\nThat, in our opinion, is not the correct legal position\tRatio of the decision\nThe section itself shows that the motivating factor for an approver to turn, what in England is called \"King's evidence\" is the hope of pardon and not any noble sentiment like contrition at the evil in which he has participated\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the evidence of the approver should in any given case be accepted or not will have to be determined by applying the usual tests such as the probability of the truth of what he has deposed to the circumstances in which he has come to give evidence whether he has made a full and complete disclosure, whether his evidence is merely self-exculpatory and so on and so forth\tRatio of the decision\nThe court has, in addition, to ascertain whether his evidence has been corroborated sufficiently in material particulars\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is necessary to consider is whether applying all these tests we should act upon the evidence of the approver should be acted upon\tRatio of the decision\nWe however, find that certain documents upon which Mr. Chari wants to rely are not included in the paper book\tRatio of the decision\nIt would take considerable time if we were to adjourn this matter now and give an opportunity to the parties to include those documents on record\tRatio of the decision\nThe better course would be for us to set aside the acquittal of the respondents and send back the appeal to the High Court ?or being decided on merits\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court will of course be bound by the finding which we have given on the questions of law agitated before us\tRatio of the decision\nWhat it must now do is to consider the entire evidence and decide for itself whether it is sufficient to bring home all or any of the offences to the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nWe may mention that the High Court's observation that the approver's evidence was treated as unreliable by the learned Additional Sessions judge is not correct\tRatio of the decision\nOf course, the view taken by the Additional Sessions judge is not binding on the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nBut it should remove from its mind the misconception that the Additional Sessions judge has not believed him\tRatio of the decision\nThere is another thing which we would like to make clear\tRatio of the decision\nThe decision in Sarwan Singh v. The State of Punjab ([1957] B. C. R. 953.), on which reliance has been placed by the High Court has been explained by this Court in the case of Maj\tRatio of the decision\nE. G. Barsay v. The State of Bombay\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court has pointed out in the latter decision that while it must be shown that the approver is a witness of truth, the evidence adduced in a case cannot be considered in compartments and that even for judging the credibility of, the approver the evidence led to corroborate him in material particulars would be relevant for consideration\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court should bear this in mind for deciding whether the evidence of the approver should be acted upon or not\tRatio of the decision\nThen again it would not be sufficient for the High Court to deal with the evidence in a general way\tRatio of the decision\nIt would be necessary for it to consider for itself the evidence adduced by the prosecution on the specific charges and then to conclude whether those charges have been established or not\tRatio of the decision\nThe prosecution would be well, advised if, instead of placing the evidence on each and every one of those large number of charges against the respondents, it chooses to select a few charges under each head other than the head of conspiracy and concentrates on establishing those charges, this would save public time and also serve the purpose of the prosecution\tRatio of the decision\nWith these observations we set aside the acquittal of the respondents and remit the appeal to the High Court for decision on merits in the light of our observations\tRatio of the decision\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nCase remanded\tRuling by Present Court\n"

accused was convicted for offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code,1860 (in short the 'IPC') and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-with default stipulation by Principal District Judge,Madurai\tFacts\nHe was also convicted for offences punishable under Section 392 read with Section 397 IPC and sentence to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine\tFacts\nBackground facts in a nutshell are as follows\tFacts\nThe deceased is one Mayurani,a Sri Lankan student,who was residing in the first floor of the house belonging to one Solsimalai (P.W.1).The Accused is also a Sri Lankan student studying in a different college,but staying in the second floor of the same premises\tFacts\nThe occurrence allegedly took place in the afternoon of 22.4.2003\tFacts\nThe First Information Report was lodged by P.W.1 on 24-4-2003 at about 9.30 A.M.It was indicated in the First Information Report that on 24.4.2003 at 9.00 A.M.,while the informant had gone to perform pooja in the first floor of the house,he got foul smell in the last room of the first floor and found blood seeping through the front door\tFacts\nOn opening the window he noticed that Mayurani was lying in a pool of blood with her face covered with a bag\tFacts\nOn the basis of the aforesaid F.I.R.,investigation was taken up initially by P.W.40\tFacts\nSubsequently on the basis of the order of the High Court,such investigation was completed by P.W.42.The accused is stated to have been arrested on suspicion on 26.4.2003.On the basis of the statement of the accused,prosecution discovered many materials including a knife and a log allegedly used for killing\tFacts\nInitially,P.W.40 suspected the role of P.W.1,his wife P.W.2,P.W.3,from whose house certain incriminating material were recovered allegedly on the basis of statement of the accused as well as P.W.4,who was working as a cleaner in the vehicle of P.W.1.Subsequently,however,P.W.42,who took over investigation from P.W.40 filed charge-sheet only against the present appellant on the footing that P.Ws.1 to 4 had no role to play in the crime\tFacts\nThe prosecution relied upon only circumstantial evidence,namely,confessional statements of the accused leading to recovery of various incriminating materials\tFacts\nEx.P-6 is the statement leading to recovery of Travel bags (M.Os.2 & 3),knife (.M.0.5),wooden log (M.0.28),rubber gloves (M.0.29 series) cotton rope with human hair (MN.O.30 series),two sponges soaked with blood (M.0.31 series),bloodstained blue clolour jean pant (M.0.32),bloodstained white banian (M.0.33),colour banian (M.0.34),bloodstained grey colour pant (M.0.35),bloodstained pillow (M.0.36),plastic bucket (M.0.37) from the house of P.W.3.Ex-P-8 is the statement leading to recovery of computer and its accessories (M.Os.6 to 17) from the house of P.W.15,a classmate of the accused\tFacts\nEx.P-10 is the statement relating to jewelleries,ultimately leading to recovery of gold ingots (M.O.18 series) from the house of P.W.19 on the basis of other connecting statements of P.W.17 and P.W.18.These three statements,Exs\tFacts\nP-6,P-8 and P-10 dated 26-4-2003,were made before P.W.40 in the presence of P.W.22 and C.W.1.The other confessional statement Ex.P-12 dated 22-9-2003 made before P.W.42 and Subbiah and P.W.24,led to recovery of \"M\" dollar (M.0.38) and key chain with key chain in (M.0.39) from the toilet in the room of the accused\tFacts\nThe prosecution has also relied upon the alleged motive to the effect that the accused urgently wanted money with a view to increase his marks in Mathematics and,therefore,the accused had stolen articles belonging to the deceased\tFacts\nThe trial court found the respondent guilty and recorded conviction and imposed sentence as aforestated\tFacts\nThe trial court found that the prosecution version rested on circumstantial evidence\tFacts\nThe following circumstances were highlighted to find the accused guilty\tFacts\na\tFacts\nThe death is homicidal; (b\tFacts\nThe accused was in need of money to chase mathematics paper and for the aforesaid purpose he has killed the deceased to take away the valuable articles like computer and gold ornaments to sell such articles in the market\tFacts\nc\tFacts\nAt the time of occurrence,only the accused,deceased and PW 9 were available in the premises and there was no other person\tFacts\nd) Statement of the accused leading to recovery of incriminating materials such as knife,rope,clothes,wooden log and other valuable articles such as computer,gold ornaments,\"M\tFacts\nDollar and the key chain with key belonging to the deceased\tFacts\nThe High Court found that the circumstances highlighted were not sufficient to fasten the guilt on the accused,and directed acquittal\tFacts\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court failed to notice that the circumstances highlighted clearly establish the chain of circumstances which established the prosecution version and the High Court was not justified in directing acquittal\tFacts\nLearned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the judgment of the High Court\tFacts\nThe conviction based on circumstantial evidence has been highlighted by this Court in various orders of this Court\tFacts\nIt has been consistently laid down by this Court that where a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence,the inference of guilt can be justified only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person.(See Hukam Singh v\tRatio of the decision\nState of Rajasthan AIR (1977 SC 1063 1977 Indlaw SC 433); Eradu and Ors.v\tRatio of the decision\nState of Hyderabad (AIR 1956 SC 316 1955 Indlaw SC 108); Earabhadrappa v\tRatio of the decision\nState of Karnataka (AIR 1983 SC 446 1983 Indlaw

Ashok Kumar Chatterjee v\tRatio of the decision\nState of M.P.(AIR 1989 SC 1890 1989 Indlaw SC 443).The circumstances from which an inference as to the guilt of the accused is drawn have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and have to be shown to be closely connected with the principal fact sought to be inferred from those circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nIn Bhagat Ram v\tPrecedent\nState of Punjab (AIR 1954 SC 621 1954 Indlaw SC 188),it was laid down that where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and bring the offences home beyond any reasonable doubt\tPrecedent\nWe may also make a reference to a decision of this Court in C.Chenga Reddy and Ors.v\tPrecedent\nState of A.P.(1996) 10 SCC\tPrecedent\n193 1996 Indlaw SC 3059,wherein\tPrecedent\nit has been observed thus\tPrecedent\nIn a case based on circumstantial evidence,the settled law is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature\tPrecedent\nMoreover,all the circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of evidence\tPrecedent\nFurther the proved circumstances must be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence\tPrecedent\nIn Padala Veera Reddy v\tPrecedent\nState of A.P.and Ors.(AIR 1990\tPrecedent\nSC 79 1989 Indlaw SC 31),it was laid down that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence,such evidence must satisfy the following tests: \"(1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn,must be cogently and firmly established; (2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused; (3) the circumstances,taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else; and (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence\tPrecedent\nIn State of U.P.v\tPrecedent\nAshok Kumar Srivastava,(1992 Crl\tPrecedent\nLJ 1104\tPrecedent\n1992 Indlaw SC 107),it was pointed out that great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences,the one in favour of the accused must be accepted\tPrecedent\nIt was also pointed out that the circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt\tPrecedent\nSir Alfred Wills in his admirable book \"Wills' Circumstantial Evidence\" (Chapter VI) lays down the following rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence: (1) the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum; (2) the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact,which infers legal accountability; (3) in all cases,whether of direct or circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits; (4) in order to justify the inference of guilt,the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation,upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt, (5) if there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused,he is entitled as of right to be acquitted\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch-stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this Court as far back as in 1952\tRatio of the decision\nIn Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and Anr\tPrecedent\nV.State of Madhya\tPrecedent\nPradesh,(AIR 1952 SC 343 1952 Indlaw SC 89),wherein it was observed thus: \"It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused\tPrecedent\nAgain,the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved\tPrecedent\nIn other words,there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused\tPrecedent\nA reference may be made to a later decision in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v\tPrecedent\nState of Maharashtra,(AIR 1984 SC 1622 1984 Indlaw SC 432).Therein,while dealing with circumstantial evidence,it has been held that onus was on the prosecution to prove that the chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in prosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea\tPrecedent\nThe conditions precedent in the words of this Court,before conviction could be based on circumstantial evidence,must be fully established\tPrecedent\nThey are: (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established\tPrecedent\nThe circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established; (2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused,that is to say,they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty; (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency; (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved; and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so compete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused\tPrecedent\nThese aspects were highlighted in State of Rajasthan v\tRatio of the decision\nRajaram (2003(8) SCC 180 2003 Indlaw SC 630),State of Haryana v\tRatio of the decision\nJagbir Singh & Anr.(2003(11) SCC 261 2003 Indlaw SC 807\tRatio of the decision\nThe main circumstances relied upon by the prosecution relates to the statements of the accused leading to discovery of materials facts,admissible under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act,1872 (in short the 'Evidence Act\tRatio of the decision\nLaw is well settled that the prosecution while relying upon the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles under Section 27 of the Evidence Act,has to prove through cogent evidence that the statement has been made voluntarily and leads to discovery of the relevant facts\tRatio of the decision\nThe scope and ambit of Section 27 of the Evidence Act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this Court\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,in almost all such decisions reference is made to the observation of the Privy Council in Pulukuri Kotayya v\tPrecedent\nEmperor (AIR 1947 PC 67 1946 Indlaw PC 23).It is worthwhile to extract such quoted observation: \"It is fallacious to treat the 'fact discovered' within the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this and the information given must relate distinctly to this fact\tPrecedent\nInformation as to past user or the past history,of the object produced is not related to his discovery in the setting in which it is discovered\tPrecedent\nInformation supplied by a person in custody that 'I will produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house' does not lead to the discovery of the knife; knives were discovered many years ago\tPrecedent\nIt leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his knowledge,and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of the offence,the fact discovered is very relevant\tPrecedent\nBut if to the statement the words be added 'with which stabbed A',these words are inadmissible since they do not related to the discovery of the knife in the house of the informant\tPrecedent\nAt one time it was held that the expression \"fact discovered\" in the section is restricted to a physical or material fact which can be perceived by the senses,and that it does not include a mental fact,now it is fairly settled that the expression \"fact discovered\" includes not only the physical object produced,but also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this,as noted in Pulukuri Kottaya's case 1946 Indlaw PC 23 (supra\tRatio of the decision\nThe various requirements of the section can be summed up as follows\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact of which evidence is sought to be given must be relevant to the issue\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be borne in mind that the provision has nothing to do with the question of relevancy\tRatio of the decision\nThe relevancy of the fact discovered must be established according to the prescriptions relating to relevancy of other evidence connecting it with the crime in order to make the fact discovered admissible\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact must have been discovered\tRatio of the decision\nThe discovery must have been in consequence of some information received from the accused and not by the accused's own act\tRatio of the decision\nThe person giving the information must be accused of any offence\tRatio of the decision\nHe must be in the custody of a police officer\tRatio of the decision\nThe discovery of a fact in consequence of information received from an accused in custody must be deposed to\tRatio of the decision\n7) Thereupon only that portion of the information which relates distinctly or strictly to the fact discovered can be proved\tRatio of the decision\nThe rest is inadmissible\tRatio of the decision\nAs observed in Pulukuri Kottaya's case 1946 Indlaw PC 23 (supra) it can seldom happen that information leading to the discovery of a fact forms the foundation of the prosecution case\tRatio of the decision\nIt is one link in the chain of proof and the other links must be forged in a manner allowed by law\tRatio of the decision\nTo similar effect was the view expressed in K.Chinnaswamy Reddy v\tRatio of the decision\nState of A.P.(AIR 1962 SC 1788 1962 Indlaw SC 192\tRatio of the decision\nThe above position was highlighted in Anter Singh v\tRatio of the decision\nState of Rajasthan (AIR 2004 SC 2665 2004 Indlaw SC 79\tRatio of the decision\nIn Rammi alias Rameshwar v\tPrecedent\nState of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1999 SC 3544 1999 Indlaw SC 1512) the scope and ambit of Section 27 of the Evidence Act was analysed in great detail and it was concluded in para 12 as follows: \" True,such information is admissible in evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence Act,but admissibility alone would not render the evidence,pertaining to the above information,reliable\tPrecedent\nWhile testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused\tPrecedent\nSignificantly,the prosecution has relied upon the evidence of PW 40 who was investigating initially\tFacts\nHis evidence has to be considered in the background of what has been stated by PW 22 and CW 1.It has been accepted by the prosecution that great efforts were made by PW 40 to falsely implicate to PWs 1 to 4 and for that purpose a departmental proceeding was initiated\tFacts\nEven according to the statement of the subsequent investigating officer (PW 42),several blank papers with the signature of PW 22 and CW 1 had been by PW 40 and such documents had been used to create false records to implicate PWs 1 to 4.It is to be noted that PW 2 himself was one of the suspected person at the initial stage of investigation\tFacts\nThat apart,materials on record such as the statement of P.W.22 recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973\tRatio of the decision\nin short 'the Code') and the statement of C.W.1,raise a reasonable doubt relating to voluntariness of the alleged confession\tRatio of the decision\nP.W.22,who is a close relation of the deceased (cousin) has stated that two days after the occurrence after the information that Bala Prasanna was roaming near LIC Colony,Anna Nagar Police brought him to the Police Station and Bala Prasanna was arrested at 5.00 P.M.and was taken to the police station and a witness was present there\tRatio of the decision\nIt is further stated that at the time of enquiry,the accused was beaten up by the police and they have seized a gold ring and Rs.5000/-cash from him\tRatio of the decision\nIf this is the statement of P.W.22 recorded under Section 164 of the Code a witness in whose presence the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles from the house of Hajeeali,P.W.3 had been made,it raises serious doubt regarding the voluntariness of the statement\tRatio of the decision\nIn this context,it is also note worthy to indicate that C.W.1 in his evidence has stated that the accused was in police station on 24-4-2003 itself\tRatio of the decision\nSimilar statement is made by P.W.4.That apart,C.W.1 has stated that no statement has been made in his presence\tRatio of the decision\nThe prosecution version to the effect that even some signatures on blank papers had been taken from P.W.22 and C.W.1 thus assumes great importance\tRatio of the decision\nThe alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife,bloodstained clothes,rope,etc\tRatio of the decision\nUnfortunately,for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused,save and except the alleged confessional statement\tRatio of the decision\nNo witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of P.W.3 and at the initial stage of investigation,P.W.3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the statement of P.W.3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt\tRatio of the decision\nMoreover,there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nThe knife did not contain any bloodstain\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of P.W.3 and his mother cannot be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence\tRatio of the decision\nThe next recovery relates to recovery of computer and accessories\tRatio of the decision\nApart from the fact that there is niggling doubt about the so called confession,in view of statement under Section 164 of the Code of P.W.22 and the statement of C.W.1,a further doubt is raised regarding such aspect in view of evidence of C.W.1 to the effect that he had seen such computer in the room of the deceased when they had gone to the room after the offence was reported\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that C.W.1 is a close relation of the deceased adds weight to his evidence rather than taking it away\tRatio of the decision\nEven accepting that the computer had been given to P.W.15 by the accused,such circumstance by itself does not unerringly points towards the guilt of the accused either in respect of offence of murder or even robbery\tRatio of the decision\nIt is quite possible that such articles might have been borrowed by the accused from the deceased and not necessarily stolen by the accused from the deceased after killing her\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that P.W.9 had not initially stated anything before P.W.40 about the accused coming down with computer at 3.30 P.M.and stated so for the first time when she was re-examined after 5 months cannot be lost sight of\tRatio of the decision\nAs a matter of fact,P.W.9 who was examined on the very date when police started investigation did not inform the police that she had seen the accused coming down from upstairs or that the accused had threatened her\tRatio of the decision\nHer statement to the following: \"I did not tell anyone that Balaprasanna took away the computer and threatened me\tRatio of the decision\nI did not tell this even to the Inspector of Police after going to the police station\tRatio of the decision\nI do not tell this even to P.W.1\tRatio of the decision\nThe next recovery relates to the ingots\tRatio of the decision\nFor the aforesaid aspect,the evidence of P.Ws.17,18 and 19 is relevant\tRatio of the decision\nSince the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots,it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nIf the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery,there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution\tRatio of the decision\nThe prosecution has strongly relied upon the fact that \"M\" Dollar belonging to the deceased and a chain with key of the room of the deceased were discovered from inside the toilet in the room which was previously occupied by the accused\tRatio of the decision\nFor the aforesaid purpose,they have relied upon the evidence of P.W.42 and the seizure witness P.W.24.The accused had allegedly made earlier confessional statement before P.W.40 on 26-4-2003 leading to discovery of several articles\tRatio of the decision\nThe subsequent statement spoken to by P.W.42,the subsequent Investigating Officer,is alleged to have been made only in September,2003,after about five months\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as the first confession statement made before P.W.40 is concerned,admittedly the accused was under physical custody,at that time,whereas at the time of last confession stated to have been made before P.W.42,the accused was on bail and he had been summoned by P.W.42 for further examination and,therefore,technically in custody\tRatio of the decision\nIf the accused had not made such a statement at such first instance,when he had confessed about other articles,it is not understood as to how after 5 months when he was on bail he would make such a statement\tRatio of the decision\nSuch alleged confession made belatedly thus creates doubt regarding its authenticity or voluntariness\tRatio of the decision\nIn this context,it is to be noted that C.W.1 states that \"M\" Dollar was taken from him by P.W.42 for the purpose of facilitating investigation\tRatio of the decision\nKeeping in view the fact that C.W.1 is a close relation of the deceased and obviously interested in punishing the real culprit,such a statement coming from C.W.1 cannot be slightly brushed aside\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by P.W.1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of P.W.1,cannot be lost sight of\tRatio of the decision\nIt is of course true that the prosecution has tried to exonerate P.W.1 by adducing evidence through P.Ws.36 and 39 to the effect that immediately after recovery of the dead body,P.W.40 had taken two such keys,thus contradicting the alleged confession of P.W.1.However,the very suspicious role of P.W.40,who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months\tRatio of the decision\nLaw is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence,all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the judgment of the High Court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this Court as regards circumstantial evidence,the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal is dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

notified date under the Act on Wara basis giving 1/3rd of the share in the foodgrains to respondent No.4.Accordingly,the appellants prayed for an order of occupancy right in respect of the scheduled land alleging that they and their father were cultivating the scheduled land as occupancy\tFacts\nright holders relying,inter alia,on the entries under the RTC record\tFacts\nThe case of the appellants,as made out,was disputed by the respondent No.4.The case of respondent No.4 was that the scheduled land was mortgaged to the 3rd respondent,Rajashankar,in the year 1968 and after the expiry of the said mortgage,the mortgagee was liable to deliver possession of the same\tFacts\nThe case of tenancy as made out by the appellants or their father was denied\tFacts\nIt was alleged by the respondent No.4 that since the respondent No.3 was a film actor and had settled in Madras (now Chennai),with the consent of the respondent No.3,the scheduled land was given to the father of the appellants and the father of the appellants was cultivating the same from the year 1968 but not as a tenant\tFacts\nAccordingly,they prayed for rejection of the application filed by the father of the appellants claiming occupancy rights under the Act\tFacts\nInitially,the Land Tribunal allowed the application of the father of the appellants and feeling aggrieved; a writ petition was filed against the said order\tFacts\nThe High Court had set aside the order of the Land Tribunal and remanded the case back to the Tribunal for a fresh decision\tFacts\nThe Land Tribunal,after remand,relying on the entries in the RTC record and some other materials on record,granted occupancy rights in favour of the appellants\tFacts\nFeeling aggrieved,the respondent No.4 filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority,which was also dismissed\tFacts\nA revision petition,thereafter,was moved before the High Court and the High Court,by the impugned judgment,had set aside the concurrent findings of fact and rejected the application filed by the father,since deceased,of the appellants holding,inter alia,that the appellants or their father had failed to prove the tenancy in respect of the scheduled land\tFacts\nA special leave petition was filed against the judgment of the High Court,setting aside the concurrent orders allowing the application,in respect of which leave has already been granted\tFacts\nWe have heard Mr\tRatio of the decision\nRaju,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and Mr\tRatio of the decision\nS.N.Bhat,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nWe have examined the impugned judgment of the High Court as well as the orders of the Tribunals below\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that the High Court,while exercising its revisional power under Section 121A of the Act,had set aside the concurrent findings of fact of the Land Tribunal as well as of the appellate authority,even then,examining the findings of the High Court and considering the power conferred on it in the revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court in the exercise of our power u/art.136 of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nWhile setting aside the findings of the Tribunal,the High Court,at paragraph 7 of the impugned judgment made the following findings: \"It is an undisputed fact that the revision petitioner has mortgaged the land in dispute in favour of the 5th respondent,Rajashankar in the year 1968 and after the expiry of the mortgage period,since the 5th respondent failed to deliver back the possession of the land in dispute to him,he filed the suit for redemption and obtained a decree for redemption\tFacts\nWhen the matter stood thus,the father of the respondent Nos.3 and 4 Gondappa,who is the uncle of the 5th respondent,Rajashankar,filed Form No.7 before the Land Tribunal claiming occupancy rights in respect of the land in dispute contending that he is the tenant of the said land,under the 5th respondent from the year 1968,i.e.subsequent to the date of mortgage\tFacts\nTo prove this fact,he relied upon the entries in the R.T.C.extract for the years 1968 to 1974 wherein his name is shown as the person in cultivation of the land in dispute\tFacts\nBut,it is significant to note that the nature of cultivation of the land is not shown as that of a tenant in the said R.T.C.extracts\tFacts\nIn one year,the nature of cultivation is described as \"Swantha\"and in the years,the column is left blank\tFacts\nThus the R.T.C.extracts produced by him do not support his contention that he was cultivating the land in dispute as a tenant\tFacts\nHe has not produced any Geni receipts or any Lease Agreement to show that the 5th respondent has leased out the land in dispute in his favour on crop share basis and that he paid the Geni to the 5th respondent\tFacts\nThus,he has no documentary evidence in respect of his claim that he came in possession of the land in dispute as a tenant under the 5th respondent and that he was cultivating the land in dispute as a tenant\tFacts\nIt is further significant to note that in the evidence given by the respondent No.3 before the Land Tribunal,he claimed that his father has taken the land in dispute on lease in the year 1962,from the father of the petitioners,Gundu Rao\tFacts\nEven in respect of the said claim,he failed to produce any documentary evidence evidencing the said lease of land in dispute from Gundu Rao\tFacts\nOn the other hand,in Form No.7 filed by Gondappa,the father of the respondents 3 and 4,he alleged that he was the tenant under the 5th respondent in respect of the land in dispute from the year 1968\tFacts\nThus,there is no consistent stand regarding the year of commencement of tenancy or under whom,Gondappa,the father of the respondents 3 and 4 became the tenant\tFacts\nSo,the only question which arises for consideration is whether the said cultivation of the land in dispute by the father of the respondents 3 and 4 during the years 1968 to 1974 can be presumed to be that of a tenant under the provisions of S.4 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act\tFacts\nS.4 of the Act makes it clear that a member of the owner's family cannot be considered as a deemed tenant,even if he is lawfully cultivating the land belonging to owner\tFacts\nIn the present case,since the father of the respondents 3 and 4,is the uncle of the respondent No.5,it cannot be said that he is not a member of the family of the respondent No.5\tFacts\nThough there is no evidence on record to show that there are any joint family properties belonging to the joint family of respondent No.5 and his uncle,there is nothing on record to show that they are not living as members of the joint family\tFacts\nSo,it is not possible to presume that the father of the respondent Nos.3 and 4 Gondappa,who is the uncle of respondent No.5 was not the member of the family of the mortgagee,respondent No.5\tFacts\nAgain,the High Court,while setting aside the findings of fact also made the following findings: \"But in the instant case,since the respondents 3 and 4 failed to produce any evidence to show that their father was cultivating the land in dispute as a tenant under the 5th respondent mortgagee and even when the entries in the R.T.C.extract produced do not support the claim of tenancy set up by the father of the respondents 3 and 4,the question of drawing presumption of deemed tenancy in his favour under S.4 of the Act does not arise\tFacts\nThe father of the respondents 3 and 4,being the uncle of respondent No.5-Mortgagee,it is also quite possible that he might have been allowed to cultivate the land in dispute under the personal supervision of respondent No.5 by assisting him in cultivation of the said land\tFacts\nIn the present case also,the respondents 3 and 4 failed to prove that their father was cultivating the land in dispute from the year 1968 as a tenant under the respondent No.5 and that after the death of their father,they continued as tenants in respect of the land in dispute\tFacts\nIt is also significant to note that the respondent No.5,who was alive when the enquiry was pending before the Land Tribunal has not given evidence in favour of the respondents 3 and 4 stating that he has leased out the land in dispute in favour of the respondents 3 and 4.Except the interested testimony of respondents 3 and 4,there is nothing else on record to show that their father was inducted as a tenant to cultivate the land in dispute by the 5th respondent after the land is dispute was taken on mortgage by him\tFacts\nSo,it is not possible to presume that the father of the respondents 3 and 4 was inducted as a tenant by the mortgagee,the 5th respondent,in respect of the land in dispute\tFacts\nSince the respondents 3 and 4 failed to produce any documentary evidence to show that their father was put in possession of the land in dispute by the 5th respondent,mortgagee as a 'tenant' and that they are continuing as tenants in respect of the said land after the death of their father,I find that they are not entitled to grant of occupational rights\tFacts\nThe earlier decision of this Court reported in ILR 1996 KAR page 2340 that when a person fails to prove that he is cultivating the land as tenant,he cannot be granted occupational right notwithstanding the fact that he might be in possession of the land and cultivating the same,is applicable to the facts of the present case on all fours\tFacts\nFrom a careful examination of the findings given by the High Court,as quoted hereinabove,in upsetting the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunals below,we are not in a position to hold that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the concurrent orders of the Tribunals below in the exercise of its revisional power under Section 121A of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe power conferred on the High Court to revise the orders of the tribunals below has been provided in Section 121A of the Act,which runs as under: \"The High Court may at any time call for the records of any order or proceeding recorded by the Appellate authority under this Act or any other law for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality of such order or as to the regularity of such proceeding and may pass such order with respect thereto as it thinks fit\tStatute\nFrom a plain reading of Section 121A of the Act,under which revisional jurisdiction can be exercised,it would be clear that the High Court,while exercising such power is entitled to re-appreciate the evidence when it finds that the conclusion arrived at by the appellate authority runs contrary to the materials on record and when it finds that there is no evidence to support the conclusion of the appellate authority or when it finds that the reasons given by the appellate authority are absolutely perverse and cannot be supported by the evidence on record\tRatio of the decision\nIt would also be clear from a plain reading of Section 121A of the Act that the High Court is also entitled to interfere with the orders of the Tribunals below when the material evidence on record was ignored or a finding was such that no court would come to such conclusion or that the decision of the Tribunals below was manifestly unjust\tRatio of the decision\nWe have carefully examined the provisions under Section 121A of the Act,which is the revisional power under the Act,and also the provisions u/s.115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short \"the Code\").So far as S.115 of the Code is concerned,it has been made clear that it is only in case of a jurisdictional error or when the courts below had acted with material irregularity in the exercise of their jurisdiction that the question of interfering with such an order can arise,otherwise,the High Court is not entitled to interfere with any other order which does not satisfy the conditions laid down for interference u/s.115 of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other hand,in our view,under Section 121A of the Act,it would be open to the High Court to interfere with the orders of the tribunals below as the High Court is empowered to look into the legality of the order or regularity of the proceedings although,in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction u/s.115 of the Code,the High Court is not entitled to look into the legality of the order or the regularity of the proceedings but only entitled to interfere with the orders of the Tribunals or the courts below when it finds that they have a) exercised a jurisdiction not vested in them by law,or b) failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested,or c) acted in the exercise of their jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity\tRatio of the decision\nReading the aforesaid provisions viz.,Section 121A of the Act and S.115 of the Code,we have no hesitation in our mind to hold that the revisional power exercised by the High Court under section 121A of the Act is wider than the one exercised by the High Court in its revisional jurisdiction u/s.115 of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nAs noted herein earlier,since section 121A of the Act clearly empowers the High Court to look into the legality of the orders impugned,therefore,it would be open to the High Court to consider the material evidence on record,when it finds that such evidence was not at all considered by the tribunals below or when the conclusion arrived at by the tribunals below run contrary to the materials on record or when it finds that there is no evidence to support the conclusion of the tribunals below or that the reasons given by the tribunals below are absolutely perverse or a finding was such that no court would come to such a conclusion or that the decisions of the tribunals below were manifestly unjust\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,under section 121A of the Act,in the presence of any of the abovementioned circumstances,the High Court is empowered to look into the legality of the orders impugned in deciding the question whether the appellants could be held to be the tenants under the respondent Nos.3 or 4\tRatio of the decision\nKeeping the aforesaid principles in mind as to when the High Court would be justified,in the exercise of its power under Section 121A of the Act,to examine the legality of the orders of the tribunals below in an appropriate case,let us now examine the findings of the High Court,while setting aside the concurrent findings of fact of the Tribunals below\tRatio of the decision\nIn our view,on a careful examination of the findings of the High Court,which were based on consideration of the material evidence on record,it is difficult for us to hold that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the concurrent findings of fact of the tribunals below in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nWe have already noted the findings made by the High Court in the impugned judgment on the question whether the appellants could be held to be the tenants on the evidence and materials on record\tRatio of the decision\nWhile doing so,in our view,the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the evidence and material on record would clearly establish that the appellants were not able to prove that they were the tenants in respect of the scheduled land under the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nOne of the main criteria for deciding whether a particular person is a tenant or not is to see whether there was payment of rent,either in cash or in kind\tRatio of the decision\nIn this case,while rejecting the claim of the appellants,the High Court had considered that the appellants had failed to satisfy the court that any payment of rent was made either by the father of the appellants or by the appellants themselves\tRatio of the decision\nThe tribunals below,while accepting the case of the appellants,had relied on the entries made in the RTC record in respect of certain period\tRatio of the decision\nWhile considering such entries,the High Court had rightly held that from the entries in the RTC record for the years 1968 to 1974,the name of the appellants was not shown as the person in cultivation of the land in dispute and also the nature of cultivation of the scheduled land was not shown as that of the tenants in the said RTC record\tRatio of the decision\nThat being the position,the High Court had come to a proper conclusion that the entries in the RTC extracts produced by the appellants could not support the contention that they were cultivating the land in dispute as the tenants\tRatio of the decision\nIn our view also,the High Court was fully justified in drawing an adverse inference against the appellants for not producing any Geni receipts or any lease agreement to show that the 5th respondent before the High Court (respondent No.3 herein) had,in fact,leased out the scheduled land in favour of the appellants or their father,since deceased,on crop share basis and that the appellants had paid the Geni to the 5th respondent\tRatio of the decision\nSuch being the findings arrived at by the High Court with which we are in concurrence,it is difficult to hold that the tenancy claimed by the appellants in respect of the scheduled land could be established\tRatio of the decision\nConsidering the above aspect of the matter and after considering the scope of Section 121A of the Act,we are,therefore,unable to agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,the High Court was not entitled to set aside the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the appellate authority and the land tribunal\tRatio of the decision\nSuch being the position,we do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court,although the High Court,in the exercise of its power under Section 121A of the Act,had set aside the concurrent orders of the appellate authority as well as the land tribunal\tRatio of the decision\nMr\tArgument\nRaju,the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants,however,contended before us that it was not open to the High Court,in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,to interfere with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the appellate authority and the Land Tribunal\tArgument\nIn support of his contention,he had relied on a decision of this Court in the case of Dahya Lal & Ors.vs\tArgument\nRasul Mohammed Abdul Rahim [1963 (3) SCR 1].1962 Indlaw SC 366\tArgument\nHe also relied on a decision of this Court in the case of Mohan Balaku Patil & Ors.vs\tArgument\nKrishnoji Bhaurao Hundre (Dead\tArgument\nBy Lrs.[(2000) 1 SCC 518] 1999 Indlaw SC 941 and Krishtappa Yellappa Pujar & Ors.vs\tArgument\nRam Samsthan Beladhadi [(1999) 1 SCC 74].1998 Indlaw SC 1197\tArgument\nIn our view,so far as the decision in the case of Mohan Balaku Patil & Ors.vs\tArgument\nBy Lrs.[(2000) 1 SCC 518] 1999 Indlaw SC 941 is concerned,it is difficult to conceive how this decision could be of any help to the appellants\tArgument\nIn that case,the findings recorded by the appellate authority as affirmed by the High Court by placing reliance on the entries made in the record of rights to the effect that the appellants were not in possession of the land on the relevant date nor were they cultivating the same,were not accepted by this court\tRatio of the decision\nIn any view of the matter,in that decision,relying on the aforesaid findings,this Court also had set aside the order made by the appellate authority as affirmed by the High Court in revision and restored the order made by the land tribunal\tRatio of the decision\nIf that case is of any help to the facts of the present case,it would be in favour of the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as Krishtappa Yellapa Pujar & Ors.vs\tRatio of the decision\nRam Samsthan Beladhadi [(1999) 1 SCC 74] is concerned,we again fail to understand that how this could be of any help to the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIn that decision,it has been made clear that the High Court was entitled to interfere with the orders of the appellate authority only on question of law or irregularity in procedure and on no other aspect\tRatio of the decision\nIn our view,we have already held that the High Court was entitled to interfere with the concurrent orders of the tribunals below as material evidence on record was not considered at all and non consideration of the material evidence on record is a question of law and,therefore,the High Court was entitled to interfere\tRatio of the decision\nAccordingly,this decision is of no help to the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nLastly,in our view,in view of the discussion made herein above,the decision relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant in the case of Dahya Lal & Ors.vs\tRatio of the decision\nRasul Mohammed Abdul Rahim [1963 (3) SCR 1 1962 Indlaw SC 366] need not be discussed\tRatio of the decision\nThere is another aspect of this matter\tRatio of the decision\nEven assuming that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the concurrent findings of fact in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,then also,we are of the view that it is not a fit case where this Court should interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court in the exercise of our power u/art.136 of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nIn Union of India & Ors.vs\tPrecedent\nGangadhar Narsingdas Aggarwal & Anr.[(1997) 10 SCC 305],1995 Indlaw SC 1227 this Court,while declining to interfere with the order of the High Court in the exercise of its power u/art.136 of the Constitution,held that even if two views are possible,the view taken by the High Court being a plausible one,it would not call for intervention by this Court u/art.136 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nConsidering the concurrent orders of the appellate authority and the land tribunal and the impugned order of the High Court,we are in agreement with the High Court because the view taken by it was plausible and therefore,the question of interference by us u/art.136 of the Constitution is not warranted\tRatio of the decision\nAgain in Jai Mangal Oraon vs\tPrecedent\nMira Nayak (Smt.) & Ors.[(2000) 5 SCC 141\tPrecedent\n2000 Indlaw SC 332,this Court had laid down that when there was nothing illegal and wrong in the reasoning and conclusions arrived at by the High Court and the same appeared to be well merited and in accordance with the interpretation of statutory provisions,this Court would not interfere with the order of the High Court u/art.136 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nWe have already considered the findings made by the High Court while setting aside the concurrent orders of the tribunals below and found that the same appear to be well merited and in accordance with the material evidence on record,therefore,this Court would not interfere with the order of the High Court u/art.136 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nFinally in Taherakhatoon (D) By Lrs\tPrecedent\nVs\tPrecedent\nSalambin Mohammad [(1992) 2 SCC 635 1992 Indlaw SC 355],this Court at paragraph 20 has observed as follows : \"In view of the above decisions,even though we are now dealing with the appeal after grant of special leave,we are not bound to go into merits and even if we do so and declare the law or point out the error\tPrecedent\nstill we may not interfere if the justice of the case on facts does not require interference or if we feel that the relief could be moulded in a different fashion\tPrecedent\nIn view of the aforesaid,we are,therefore,of the view that this is not a fit case where this Court shall interfere with the order passed by the High Court under Section 121A of the Act.19.For the reasons aforesaid,this appeal fails and is dismissed without any order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

Rao, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the Appellants in Civil Appeal No.335 of 2002, took us through materials on records and contended that the Appellants herein became 'permanent employees' of the Respondents having regard to the provisions contained in S. 2 of the 1961 Act and Order 2(i) and 2(vi) of the Standard Standing Orders as set out in the Annexure appended to the 1963 Rules defining 'permanent employees' and the 'temporary employees\tArgument\nPlacing reliance on several documents which have come into existence at a subsequent stage, Dr. Dhawan would contend that vacancies in fact had arisen after passing of the judgment of the High Court and, thus the services of the Appellants should be regularized there against\tArgument\nThe vacancies, according to the learned counsel, need not be permanent ones\tArgument\nIt was urged that the expression 'clear vacancies' has to be read in the context of period for which the concerned workman was required to work, namely, six months\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would argue that the job was required to be performed for six months for which somebody else could have been appointed so as to attract the provisions of the 1961 Act and the 1963 Rules\tArgument\nDr. Dhawan would furthermore contend that the findings of fact had been arrived at by the Labour Court that the Appellants of Civil Appeal No.337 of 2002 were appointed by the Authority and not only their work was being taken in the Project but also in other works, and, thus, mere posting of the Appellants to the said Project would not disentitle them from the benefit of the said Act\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would urge that a seniority list was also drawn up and an employment code was assigned to each one of the Appellants from which fact the nature of their employment should be judged\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would submit that the sufficient materials were brought on records to show that vacancies were available and as the Appellants worked for a period of more than six months, they became permanent employees in terms of the Act\tArgument\nIt was further contended that as the Respondents despite direction to produce documents including the offers for appointment did not produce the same, an adverse inference should have been drawn against them by the High Court\tArgument\nAs regard the claim of 'equal pay for equal work', the learned counsel would urge that the High Court has failed to consider the same in its true perspective\tArgument\nMr. V.R. Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents, on the other hand, would contend that indisputably the Appellants were engaged by the Respondent-Authority but such appointments were made for the purpose of the Project financed by ODA\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would submit that in fact no appointment letter was issued to the Appellants\tArgument\nOur attention was also drawn to the application dated 22.10.1991 filed by one O.P. Mandloi before the Chairman of the Indore Development Authority disclosing his educational qualifications and enclosing therewith the mark-sheets and degrees obtained by him in Civil Engineering and also Secondary School Examination Certificate to show his date of birth\tArgument\nwhereupon the Chief Executive Officer on the body of the said application itself, made the following endorsement : \"He may be tried in daily wages and should be entrusted with the work of progress collection of ODA work put with (Illegible\tArgument\nSd/- C.E.O. 23.10.91\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would submit that in the aforementioned premise the question of regularization of the services of the Appellants does not arise\tArgument\nDrawing our attention also to the pleadings as also the reliefs claimed for by the Appellants before the Labour Court, the learned counsel would contend that no contention was raised therein by the Appellants as regard their entitlement of permanency in terms of the provisions of the 1961 Act and the 1963 Rules\tArgument\nFurthermore, from the reliefs claimed, it would appear that the Appellants had, inter alia, prayed for continuance of their services by the Indore Municipal Corporation which knocks off the very basis of their claim\tArgument\nIt was urged that there does not exist any controversy that ODA was to continue before 30.6.1997 and as such the Appellants could not have been absorbed by the Respondent authority\tArgument\nSTATUTORY\tStatute\nPROVISIONS : S. 2(2) of the 1961 Act\tStatute\nreads as follows : \"Nothing in this Act shall apply to the employees in an undertaking to whom the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules, Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, Revised Leave Rules, Civil Service Regulations or any other rules or regulations that may be notified in this behalf by the State Government in the official Gazette apply\tStatute\nCl\tStatute\n2 of the Standard Standing Order reads as under : \"2\tStatute\nClassification of employees\tStatute\nEmployees shall be classified as (i) permanent , (ii) permanent seasonal,(iii\tStatute\nProbationers, (iv) Badlies, (v) Apprentices, and (vi) temporary\tStatute\ni\tStatute\nA 'permanent' employee is one who has completed six months' satisfactory service in a clear vacancy in one or more posts whether as a probationer or otherwise, or a person whose name has been entered in the muster roll and who is given a ticket of permanent employee; (vi\tStatute\nTemporary employee' means an employee who has been employed for work which is essentially of a temporary character, or who is temporarily employed as an additional employee in connection with the temporary increase in the work of a permanent nature; provided that in case such employee is required to work continuously for more than six months he shall be deemed to be a permanent employee, within the meaning of cl\tStatute\ni) above\tStatute\nDETERMINATION\tRatio of the decision\nThe Respondent-Authority is a State within the meaning of Art\tRatio of the decision\n12 of the Constitution of India\tPrecedent\nIt is, therefore, constitutionally obliged to strictly comply with the requirements of Arts\tRatio of the decision\n14 and 16 thereof before making any appointment\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not in dispute that the Respondent- Authority has been constituted under Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nibesh Adhiniyam, 1973 (Adhiniyam); S. 47 whereof mandates that all appointments to the posts of officers and servants included in the State cadre mentioned in Section 76-B of the Development Authority Services must be made by the State Government and the appointments to the posts of officers and servants included in the local cadre in the said services by the concerned Town and Country Development Authority\tRatio of the decision\nThe proviso appended to S. 47 of the Adhiniyam further mandates that no post shall be created in any authority without the prior sanction of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nSection 76B provides for constitution of development authorities service\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not in dispute that the State Government in exercise of its rule making power conferred upon it u/s\tRatio of the decision\n85 of the Adhiniyam has made rules known as 'M.P.

whereof the matters to be provided in the Standard Standing Orders have been specified\tStatute\nUnder sub-s\tStatute\n1) of Section 6, the State Government may, by notification, apply Standard Standing Orders to such class of undertakings and from such date as may be specified therein\tStatute\nSub-s\tStatute\n2) of S. 6 reads as under : \"Where immediately before the commencement of this Act standing order are in force in respect of any undertaking, such standing orders shall, until standard standing orders are applied to such undertaking under sub-s\tStatute\n1) continue in force as if they were made under this Act\tStatute\nNo notification has been brought to our notice that the Standard Standing Orders had been made applicable to the Appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIt is

employees of the Respondent\tRatio of the decision\nThe terms of conditions of service contained in the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules are not in derogation of the provisions contained in schedule appended to the 1961 Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe 1961 Act provides for classification of employees in five categories\tRatio of the decision\nThe 1973 Act, as noticed hereinbefore, clearly

other works carried on by the Authority is not known\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the person making an appointment had the requisite jurisdiction or not is also not clear\tRatio of the decision\nWe have noticed hereinbefore that in the case of Om Prakash Mondloi, the CEO made an endorsement to the effect that he may be tried in daily wages and should be entrusted with the work of progress

was prepared in respect of office muster employees\tRatio of the decision\nThe said seniority list was not prepared in terms of the classification of employees within the meaning of the 1961 Act and

had been appointed against a clear vacancy in one or more posts as probationers and otherwise; and (ii) whose name had been registered at muster roll and who has been given a ticket of permanent

imperative before permanency could be so claimed\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants have not produced any such ticket\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not the case of the Appellants that they had been working as Technical Supervisors and Clerks in respect of which service book may be maintained instead of issuance of a ticket\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not the case of the Appellants

recruitment of the employees is contained in Order 4 which merely provides that the Manager shall within a period of six months, lay down the procedure for recruitment of employees and notify it on the notice board on which Standing Orders are exhibited and shall send copy thereof to the Labour Commissioner\tRatio of the decision\nThe matter relating to recruitment is governed by the 1973 Act

Board).He was promoted to the post of Deputy Engineer\tFacts\nWhile he was posted at Surat as Deputy Engineer he was transferred to Ukai subdivision under the order of the Superintending Engineer dated 29th March,1974.Pursuant to the order of transfer he was relieved from his duties at Surat on 30th March,1974 to enable him to join at Ukai\tFacts\nHe made representation to the Additional Chief Engineer for cancelling his transfer order on the ground that his mother aged 70 years was ailing and it would cause great inconvenience to him if he was required to join at Ukai\tFacts\nHis representation was rejected and he was directed to join at Ukai but he did not do so instead he filed a civil suit at Baroda challenging validity of the order of transfer\tFacts\nMeanwhile,the Chief Engineer by his order dated 27th May,1974 discharged the respondent from service with effect from 31st March,1974 in accordance with service Regulation No.113.The respondent challenged the validity of the order of his discharge from service by means of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Gujarat\tFacts\nA learned Single Judge of the High Court quashed the order of termination on the findings that the order of discharge was issued m violation of the basic principles of natural justice as no opportunity was afforded to the respondent before discharging him from services under Regulation No.113\tFacts\nThe learned Single Judge granted a declaration in respondent's favour holding the order void and illegal but having regard to recalcitrant attitude of the appellant and his continued conduct of disobedience of the orders of his superior authorities,he refused to grant consequential reliefs regarding reinstatement or payment of back-wages\tFacts\nThe respondent as well as the appellant-board,both preferred Letters Patent appeals against the order of learned Single Judge\tFacts\nA Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the Appellants but it allowed the respondent's appeal\tFacts\nThe Division Bench upheld the order of the learned Single Judge holding the order of discharge illegal and void but it set aside the order of the learned Single Judge refusing to grant consequential relief instead it directed the appellants to reinstate the respondent,and to treat him in service without any break in service and to grant him benefits of increments,seniority,and promotion to which he may be entitled under the rules\tFacts\nThe Bench,however,did not grant full back-wages to the respondent instead it directed the Board to pay him 50 per cent of back-wages\tFacts\nAggrieved,the appellant has preferred the instant appeal after obtaining special leave of this Court\tFacts\nThis appeal came up for hearing before us on 28th January,1988 and on that day\tFacts\nSh\tFacts\nB.K.Mehta,Advocate appearing for the appellants and Sh\tFacts\nVimal Dave,Advocate,appearing for the respondent were fully heard\tFacts\nAfter hearing learned counsel for the parties we were satisfied that the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench both had committed error in allowing the writ petition and granting relief to the respondent\tFacts\nWe expressed our view in the Court and suggested to Mr\tFacts\nVimal Dave,counsel for the respondent,that if he agreed the original writ petition of the respondent could be dismissed without directing him to refund the amount which he had already been paid by the appellants in pursuance to the orders of the High Court and of this Court as during the pendency of the appeal\tFacts\nthe appellants were directed by means of interim order of this Court to continue to pay salary to the respondent which was being paid to him regularly\tFacts\nThe hearing was adjourned to enable Sh\tFacts\nVimal Dave,to obtain instructions from the respondent\tFacts\nThe appeal came up for hearing before us on 16.2.1988 when another counsel appeared to argue the appeal on behalf of the respondent on merits\tFacts\nWe refused to hear the counsel as we had already completed hearing\tRatio of the decision\nThereupon,the respondent himself appeared in person and sought permission to make his submissions personally\tRatio of the decision\nWe refused to accede to his request as oral heating had already been completed and the matter had been adjourned only to enable the respondent's counsel to obtain instructions\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,in the interest of justice we permitted the respondent to file written submissions.if any,in support of his case\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter,the case was listed several times but no written submissions were filed instead the respondent adopted an unusual course by sending an application by post expressing his no confidence in us with a prayer to transfer the case to some other Bench\tRatio of the decision\nSince this was unusual,uncalled for and unjustified request we ignored the same and reserved the order\tRatio of the decision\nWe are constrained to note that instead of utilizing the opportunity granted to him for filing written submissions the respondent has misused adjournments for the purposes of raising frivolous objections for getting the case transferred to some other Bench\tRatio of the decision\nNo party is entitled to get a case transferred from one Bench to the other,unless the Bench is biased or there are some reasonable grounds for the same,but no right to get a case transferred to any other Bench,can legitimately be claimed merely because the judges express opinion on the merits of the case on the conclusion of hearing\tRatio of the decision\nIn the instant case on the conclusion of the oral hearing we had expressed our opinion on 28.1.1988 in the open court,that we were inclined to allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court and dismiss the writ petition but taking a sympathetic view we requested Sh\tRatio of the decision\nVimal Dave,learned counsel appearing for the respondent to obtain instructions as aforesaid\tRatio of the decision\nThe opportunity granted to the respondent has,however,been misused by raising mischievous and frivolous objections instead of filing written submissions\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent's prayer is accordingly rejected and since oral hearing has already been completed,and in spite of several adjournments respondent failed to appear before the Court or to file the written submissions we proceed to decide the case on merits\tFacts\nTransfer of a Government servant appointed to a particular cadre of transferable posts from one place to the other is an incident of service\tRatio of the decision\nNo Government servant or employee of Public Undertaking has legal tight for being posted at any particular place\tRatio of the decision\nTransfer from one place to other is generally a condition of service and the employee has no choice in the matter\tRatio of the decision\nTransfer from one place to other is necessary in public interest and efficiency in the Public administration\tRatio of the decision\nWhenever,a public servant is transferred he must comply with the order but if there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on transfer it is open to him to make representation to the competent authority for stay,modification or cancellation of the transfer order\tRatio of the decision\nIf the order of transfer is not stayed,modified or cancelled the concerned public servant must carry out the order of transfer\tRatio of the decision\nIn the absence of any stay of the transfer order a public servant has no justification to avoid or evade the transfer order merely on the ground of having made a representation,or on the ground of his difficulty in moving from one place to the other\tRatio of the decision\nIf he fails to proceed on transfer in compliance to the transfer order,he would expose himself to disciplinary action under the relevant Rules,as has happened in the instant case\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent lost his service as he refused to comply with the order of his transfer from one place to the other\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no dispute that the respondent was holding a transferable post and under the conditions of service applicable to him he was liable to be transferred and posted at any place within the State of Gujarat\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent had no legal or statutory right to insist for being posted at one particular place\tRatio of the decision\nIn fact,during the tenure of his service in the Board the respondent had been transferred from one place to another place several times\tRatio of the decision\nIn March,1974 he was transferred .from Surat to Ukai\tRatio of the decision\nThe distance between the two places as was stated before us during the hearing of the case is less than 50 kms\tRatio of the decision\nHe was relieved from his duties at Surat on 30th March,1974\tFacts\nbut he did not join at Ukai till the impugned order of discharge was issued on May 27,1974.The\tFacts\nChief Engineer who discharged the respondent's services exercised his power under Service Regulation No.113,which runs as under: \"113.The continued absence from duty or overstay,m spite of warning,to return to duty shall render the employee liable to summarily discharge from service without the necessity of proceedings under the Gujarat Electricity Board,Conduct,Discipline and Appeal Procedure\tFacts\nThe above Rule provides that if an employee of the Gujarat Electricity Board continues to remain absent from duty or overstays the period of sanctioned leave and in spite of warning,he fails to return to duty,he renders himself liable to be discharged summarily from service without complying with the procedure prescribed for taking disciplinary action,under the Gujarat Electricity Board,Conduct,Discipline and Appeal Procedure\tRatio of the decision\nRegulation 113 confers wide powers on the authorities to summarily discharge an employee from service,if he continues to be absent from duty in an unauthorised manner and refuses to join his duty even after warning\tRatio of the decision\nUnder the disciplinary rules detailed procedure is required to be followed for removing an employee from service but Regulation 113 provides for summary discharge from service\tRatio of the decision\nBefore this power is exercised,two conditions must be satisfied; Firstly,the employee must be found to be absent from duty without leave or overstaying the period of sanctioned leave,and secondly,he failed to join his duty even after a warning\tRatio of the decision\nThe object and purpose of giving warning is to remind the delinquent employee that if he continues to be absent from duty he would be liable to action under Regulation 113 and to afford him an opportunity to make amends by joining his duty\tRatio of the decision\nIf even thereafter he fails to join duty,his services are liable to be terminated by an order of discharge\tRatio of the decision\nIt is noteworthy that the validity of Regulation 113 was not challenged before the High Court and the parties proceeded on the assumption that Regulation 113 was valid and applicable to the respondent's service\tRatio of the decision\nThe Chief Engineer discharged the respondent from service as he had continued to remain absent from duty w.e.f\tFacts\nMarch 30,1974 to May 27,1974\tFacts\nThe Division Bench of the High Court held that no warning as contemplated by service Regulation No.113 had been issued to the respondent nor he had been afforded any opportunity of showing cause before the impugned order of discharge was passed and consequently,the order of discharge was null and void being contrary to service Regulation No.113 itself\tRuling by Lower Court\nOn perusal of the material on record we are of the opinion that the view taken by the High Court is not sustainable as there is sufficient material on record which shows that warning had been issued to the respondent before the order of discharge was issued\tRatio of the decision\nIn determining the question whether any warning was given to the respondent it is necessary to refer to the sequence of events and the correspondence which ensued between the appellants and the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nOn March 29,1974 the Superintending Engineer of the Board issued the order,transferring the respondent from Surat to Ukai,on 30.3.1974 the respondent was relieved from Surat and directed to join his duty at Ukai,but the respondent did not join his duty at the new place of posting\tFacts\nInstead he made a representation to the Additional Chief Engineer on 8.4.1974 after the transfer order\tFacts\nThe Transfer order was not stayed and as the respondent did not join his duties,he continued to be absent without sanction of any leave\tFacts\nIn this situation the Superintending Engineer by his letter dated 18th April,1974 directed the respondent to show cause as to why action should not be taken against him for disobeying the order of transfer and also for unauthorised absence from duty in breach of service Regulation\tFacts\nNo.113.The letter is as under: \"GUJARAT ELECTRICITY BOARD O & M DIVISION Nana Varchha Road Surat\tFacts\nDated 18th April,1974\tFacts\nTo Shri A.S.Pohani Junior Engineer,Ukai 37,Gurunagar Society Near Jakat Naka,Surat-3\tFacts\nSub: Transfer from Surat to Ukai\tFacts\nYou have been relieved on 30.3.1974 A.N.on account of your transfer from Surat to Ukai,but you have not reported to Ukai till today and remained on unauthorised absence on relief,which is breach of S.R.No.112 and 113.Please submit your explanation as to why action should not be taken against you for disobeying order of superior and breach of S.R.No.112 and 113 within 7 days from receipt of this letter\tFacts\nSd/-Execut\tFacts\nive Engineer (O\tFacts\nM) Surat Copy f.w.c.s.to\tFacts\nSuperintending Engineer,GEB,Utran\tFacts\nThere is no dispute that the respondent received the aforesaid letter as he sent a reply to the Superintending Engineer on April 20,1974,a copy of which was annexed as Annexure 'J' by the petitioner,to his petition before the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nBy that letter respondent stated that he was waiting for the decision of his representation made for reconsideration of his transfer from Surat to Ukai and therefore,the question of his remaining on unauthorised leave was misconceived\tRatio of the decision\nSince the respondent had not obtained any sanctioned leave for his absence his absence from duty was unauthorised\tRatio of the decision\nNo Government servant or employee of any public undertaking has a right to be absent from duty without sanction of leave,merely on account of pendency of representation against the order of transfer\tRatio of the decision\nSince the respondent continued to be absent from duty the Superintending Engineer by a registered post acknowledgment due letter dated April 24,1974 informed the respondent that his request to postpone his transfer was rejected and he was directed to join his duty at Ukai and on his failure to do so disciplinary action would be taken against him\tRatio of the decision\nThe Establishment Officer (P) of the Board,also informed the respondent by his letter dated May 6,1974 that his representation against the order of transfer was not accepted and he was directed to obey the order of transfer\tFacts\nA copy of the letter filed by the petitioner himself as Annexure 'K' to the writ petition in the High Court\tFacts\nBut even thereafter,the respondent did not join his duties\tFacts\nUltimately,the Chief Engineer of the Board took action against the respondent and discharged him from service with effect from 31.3.1974 by his letter dated May 27,1974\tFacts\nThe sequence of events and the correspondence which ensued between the officers of the Board and the respondent clearly show that the respondent disobeyed the order of transfer and he remained absent from duty in an unauthorised manner without obtaining sanction of leave\tRatio of the decision\nThe aforesaid documents leave no room for any doubt that the respondent was reminded of his failure to join his duties at Ukai and he was further reminded that his unauthorised absence had exposed him to disciplinary action\tRatio of the decision\nIn fact,the Superintending Engineer had by his letter dated 18th April,1974 clearly reminded the respondent that his unauthorised absence was in breach of Service Regulation No.113 and called upon to show cause why action should not be taken against him but in spite of these letters the respondent failed to join his duties\tRatio of the decision\nThe Division Bench of the High Court has held that since no warning was issued to the respondent action taken under Service Regulation No.113 was not in accordance with law\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis finding is wholly misconceived\tRatio of the decision\nA warning need not be in any particular form\tRatio of the decision\nThe object and purpose of the warning as contemplated by the Regulation,.is to remind the delinquent employee that his continued unauthorised absence from duties was liable to result in discharge of his service\tRatio of the decision\nThe substance of the Superintending Engineer's letter dated 18th April,1974 which was admittedly served on the respondent,contained warning to the respondent,which fully met the requirement of Regulation No.113\tRatio of the decision\nBefore the High Court a controversy was raised as to whether the registered letter dated 24.4.1974 addressed by the Superintending Engineer to the respondent was received by him or not\tRatio of the decision\nThe registered cover,containing the letter dated 24.4.1974 was returned back by the postal authorities with an endorsement that the addressee refused to accept the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent's case was that no such registered letter was tendered to him by the postman nor he ever refused to accept the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe Division Bench held that letter dated 24.4.1974 which contained a warning had not been served on the respondent and since the Board had failed to raise the question before the learned Single Judge it could not do so in the letters patent appeal\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe Division Bench further held that since the letter dated 24.4.1974 was not served on the respondent,there was no material to show that any warning had been issued to the respondent before he was discharged from service\tRuling by Lower Court\nWe do not agree with the view taken by the Division Bench\tRatio of the decision\nFirstly,even if the letter dated 24.4.1974 was not served on the respondent there is no dispute that the Superintending Engineer's letter dated 18th April,1974 had been served on him\tRatio of the decision\nBy that letter warning as contemplated by Regulation No.113 had been issued to the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore even if the letter dated 24.4.1974 was not served on the respondent the order of discharge as contemplated by Regulation No.113 is sustainable in law\tRatio of the decision\nBut even otherwise,the Division Bench committed error in holding that the Board had raised the question of service of the letter dated 24.4.1974 for the first time before the Division Bench in the letters patent appeal\tRatio of the decision\nPerusal of the averments made in paragraphs 17,18,23 and 25 (2)(ii) of the counter-affidavit filed in reply to the petitioner's writ petition before the learned Single Judge shows that the Board had categorically pleaded that the respondent was informed by letter dated 24.4.1974 that his representation to postpone his transfer was rejected and he should obey the order of transfer\tRatio of the decision\nIt was further pleaded that the respondent had refused to accept the registered letter and the same had been returned back by the postal authorities with an endorsement that the addressee refused to accept the same\tRatio of the decision\nIn his rejoinder affidavit the respondent denied the aforesaid allegations and asserted that the letter was not tendered to him and he never refused to accept the registered cover and the postal endorsement was wrong and incorrect\tRatio of the decision\nApart from denying the postal endorsement,the respondent placed no material before the Court in support of his pleading\tRatio of the decision\nIn this view,we are of the opinion that the Division Bench was totally wrong in holding that no opportunity was afforded to the respondent to meet the case set up by the Board that the letter dated 24.4.1974 was served on the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nNo new plea had been raised by the Board before the Division Bench instead the plea relating to service of the aforesaid letter had already been before the learned Single Judge\tRatio of the decision\nThere is presumption of service of a letter sent under registered cover,if the same is returned back with a postal endorsement that the addressee refused to accept the same\tRatio of the decision\nNo doubt the presumption is rebuttable and it is open to the party concerned to place evidence before the Court to rebut the presumption by showing that the address mentioned on the cover was incorrect or that the postal authorities never tendered the registered letter to him or that there was no occasion for him to refuse the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe burden to rebut the presumption lies on the party,challenging the factum of service\tRatio of the decision\nIn the instant case the respondent failed to discharge this burden as he failed to place material before the Court to show that the endorsement made by the postal authorities was wrong and incorrect\tRatio of the decision\nMere denial made by ,the respondent in the circumstances of the case was not sufficient to rebut the presumption relating to service of the registered cover\tRatio of the decision\nWe are,therefore,of the opinion that the letter dated 24.4.1974 was served on the respondent and he refused to accept the same\tRatio of the decision\nConsequently,the service was complete and the view taken by the High Court is incorrect\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of the above discussion,we therefore hold that the respondent's failure to join his duties at Ukai resulted in unauthorised absence and his failure to join his duties in spite of the repeated reminders and letters issued to him constituted sufficient valid ground for taking action under Regulation No.113.We further hold that before issuing the order of discharge the respondent was not only warned but he was also afforded an opportunity to explain as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against him\tRuling by Present Court\nThe respondent acted in an irresponsible manner in not complying with the order of transfer which led to his discharge from service in accordance with the Service Regulation\tRatio of the decision\nNo.113.The learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench both erred in law in setting aside the order of discharge\tRatio of the decision\nWe,accordingly,allow the appeal,set aside the order of the Single Judge as well as Division Bench and dismiss the respondent's petition\tRuling by Present Court\nThere would be no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nThe respondent has been paid a sum of Rs.1,04,170 towards salary under the interim orders of this Court\tRuling by Present Court\nNow,since the order of discharge is held to be valid the amount paid to the respondent is liable to be recovered from him,but having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and the hardship which could be caused to the respondent,we direct the appellant not to recover the amount already paid to the respondent\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

            "text": "This appeal with special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India in a dispute regarding the workers' claim for bonus\tFacts\nDuring the year 1948 the appellant made a profit of Rs\tFacts\n11,97,648-11-9\tFacts\nIt paid 24 3 per cent\tFacts\ndividend on ordinary shares, being the maximum that could be paid under the Public Companies (Limitation of Dividend) Ordinance of 1948 and also paid to the workers their full share of bonus at annas 4 in a rupee of their basic earnings\tFacts\nDuring the year 1949 the selling rates for cloth and yarn were controlled by the Government and were approximately 4 per cent\tFacts\nbelow those obtained in 1948\tFacts\nThe basic wages were increased from the 1st December, 1948, by order of the Government of Uttar Pradesh and the total wages paid were therefore higher than those in the previous year\tFacts\nThere was moreover indiscipline amongst the workers and production suffered\tFacts\nThere was a strike in the month of October and the mills were closed for nearly a month\tFacts\nFurther the management were unable to secure cotton which resulted in the curtailment of the working hours\tFacts\nAs a result of all these circumstances the appellant suffered a trading loss of Rs\tFacts\n5,02,563-1-10\tFacts\nA sum of Rs\tFacts\n2,50,000 being the excess reserve for taxation was written back and a sum of Rs\tFacts\n10,01,871-13-5 being the amount of reserve transferred from the investment account was also brought in\tFacts\nAn aggregate sum of Rs\tFacts\n12,51,871-13-5 was thus brought into the balance sheet by these two transfers\tFacts\nThe trading loss was deducted from this amount leaving a credit balance of Rs\tFacts\n7,49,308-11-7 and that amount was shown as the profit for the year 1949 in the balance-sheet for that year\tFacts\nThe balance which had been brought forward from the previous year was added thereto and a dividend of 243/4 per cent. was paid to the ordinary shareholders\tFacts\nThe appellant also paid ex gratia to the workmen bonus at the rate of annas 2 per rupee of their basic earnings making it clear by their notification dated the 7th April, 1950, that the directors had sanctioned the payment at that rate in spite of the appellant having suffered a trading loss for the year, that it was being paid entirely at the discretion of the appellant and was not related to or connected with any contract of employment of any worker\tFacts\nOn the 4th May, 1950, the Secretary of the respondent Union petitioned to the Provincial Conciliation Officer (Textile) that there was more production in 1949 than in 1948, that there was no reason to hold that the profit in 1949 was less than in the previous year and that the rate of bonus was wrongly reduced and asked that bonus for 1949 should also be paid at the rate of annas 4 per rupee\tFacts\nThe industrial dispute which thus arose was referred for enquiry and recording of an award to the Regional Conciliation Board (Textile), Kanpur\tFacts\nThe Conciliation Board by a majority decision repelled the contention of the appellant and awarded the payment of bonus at annas 4 per rupee\tFacts\nOn an appeal taken by the appellant to the Industrial Court (Textiles and Hosiery), Kanpur, the Industrial Court accepted the contention of the appellant, allowed the appeal and set aside the award\tFacts\nThe respondent thereupon appealed to the Labour Appellate Tribunal which substantially agreed with the Industrial Court on questions of fact as well as the general position in law but imported considerations of social justice and treating this as a special case \" where social justice would demand that labour should have bonus for the year where for that very year capital had not only a reasonable return but much in excess of that \", allowed the appeal and directed the appellant to pay to the workmen bonus at the rate of annas 4 per rupee within six weeks of their decision\tFacts\nThe appellant filed this appeal against that decision after obtaining special leave from this Court\tFacts\nBoth the Industrial Court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal found as a fact that there was a trading loss of Rs\tFacts\n5,02,563-1-10 during the year 1949 and also\tFacts\nthat the dividend of 243/4 per cent\tFacts\nto the ordinary shareholders was distributed after transferring the aggregate sum of Rs\tFacts\n12,51,871-13-5 from the reserves\tFacts\nThe question which therefore arises for our consideration is mainly whether the workers are entitled to the payment of a bonus in spite of the employer having worked at a loss during the year and incidentally whether the workers have any right, title or interest in the reserves and the undistributed profits of the previous years\tRatio of the decision\nThe primary meaning of the word \" bonus \" according to the definition given in the New English Dictionary is:-\" A boon or gift over and above what is nominally due as remuneration to the receiver and which is therefore something wholly to the good\tRatio of the decision\nThis definition was adopted by Stirling J. in In re Eddystone Marine Insurance Co, L. R. (I894) W. N. 30; Webster's International Dictionary defines bonus as \"something given in addition to what is ordinarily received by or strictly due to the recipient\tRatio of the decision\nThe Oxford Concise Dictionary defines it as \" something to the good, into the bargain (and as an example) gratuity to workmen beyond their wages\tRatio of the decision\nCorpus Juris Secundum, Volume XI, at page 515 ascribes the following meanings to the word bonus: \" An allowance in addition to what is usual current or stipulated ; a sum given or paid beyond what is legally required to be paid to the recipient; something given in addition to what is ordinarily received by or strictly due to the recipient\" and adds: It has been said to carry the idea of something uncertain and indefinite, something which may or may not be paid depending on varying circumstances and under particular conditions has been said to imply a benefit accruing to him who offers it and an inducement to the offeree\tRatio of the decision\nThis imports the conception of a boon, a gift or a gratuity otherwise described as an ex gratia payment\tRatio of the decision\nThe word 'bonus' has however acquired a secondary meaning in the sphere of industrial relations\tRatio of the decision\nIt is classified amongst the methods of wage payment\tRatio of the decision\nIt has been used especially in the United States of America to designate an award in addition to the contractual wage\tRatio of the decision\nIt is usually intended as a stimulus to extra effort but sometimes represents the desire of the employer to share with his workers the fruits of their common enterprise\tRatio of the decision\nVide Encyclopaedia Britannica, Volume III, page 856\tRatio of the decision\nThe Pocket Part of the Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume XI, under the heading \"As Compensation for Services\" quotes the following passage from Attorney-General v. City of Woburn, 317 Mass. 465 :- \"The word 'bonus' is commonly used to denote an increase in salary or wages in contracts of employment\tRatio of the decision\nThe offer of a bonus is the means frequently adopted to secure continuous service from an employee to enhance his efficiency and to augment his loyalty to his employer and the employee's acceptance of the offer by performing the things called for by the offer binds employer to pay the bonus so called\tRatio of the decision\nIt also gives another meaning of the word bonus', viz:- \"Increased compensation for services already rendered gratuitously or for a prescribed compensation where there is neither express or implied understanding that additional compensation may be granted\tRatio of the decision\nThis imports the conception that even though the payment be not strictly due to the recipient nor legally enforceable by him, a claim to the same may be laid by the employee under certain conditions and if such claim is entertained either by an agreement with the employer or by adjudication before a properly constituted Tribunal as on an industrial dispute arising\tRatio of the decision\nthe same would ripen into a legally enforceable claim\tRatio of the decision\nThis position was recognised in Sutton v. Attorney-General , (1923\tPrecedent\nT.L.R. 294, 297; where the Earl of Birkenhead observed \"The term 'bonus' may of course be properly used to describe payments made of grace and not as of right\tPrecedent\nBut it nevertheless may also include, as here, payments made because legally due but which the parties contemplate will not continue indefinitely\", and in National Association of Local Government Officers v.

Supervisors of Wayne County, (1873) 83 U.S. 452 21 L., Ed\tPrecedent\nBut second, the meaning of the word 'bonus' is not given to it by the objection\tPrecedent\nIt is thus defined by Webster\tPrecedent\nA premium given for a loan or a charter or other privilege granted to a company; as, the bank paid a bonus for its charter; a sum paid in addition to a stated compensation\tPrecedent\nIt is not a gift or gratuity, but a sum paid for services, or upon a consideration in addition to or in excess of that which would ordinarily be given\" , 12\tPrecedent\nAnd also in Great Western Garment Co.

Minister of National Revenue , (1948\tPrecedent\nD.L.R. 25, 233\tPrecedent\nA bonus may be a mere gift or gratuity as a gesture of goodwill and not enforceable, or it may be something which an employee is entitled to on the happening of a condition precedent and is enforceable when the condition is fulfilled\tPrecedent\nBut in both cases it is something in addition to or in excess of that which is ordinarily received\tPrecedent\nThe Textile Labour Inquiry Committee defined 'bonus' as follows :- \"The term bonus is applied to a cash payment made in addition to wages\tPrecedent\nIt generally represents the cash incentive given conditionally on certain standards of attendance and efficiency being attained\tPrecedent\nThere are however two conditions which have to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justified and they are, (1) when wages fall short of the living standard and (2) the industry makes huge profits part of which are due to the contribution which the workmen make in increasing production\tRatio of the decision\nThe demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim when either or both these conditions are satisfied\tRatio of the decision\nThe principles for the grant of bonus were discussed and a formula was evolved by the Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Millowners' Association, Bombay v. Rashtreeya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay, (1950\tRatio of the decision\n2 L.L.J. 247;\"As\tRatio of the decision\nboth labour and capital contribute to the earnings of the industrial concern, it is fair that labour should derive some benefit, if there is a surplus after meeting prior or necessary charges\" and the following were prescribed as the first charges on gross profits, viz\tRatio of the decision\n1) Provision for depreciation, (2) Reserves for rehabilitation, (3) A return at 6 per cent\tRatio of the decision\non the paid up capital\tRatio of the decision\nA return on the working capital at a lesser rate than the return on paid up capital\tRatio of the decision\nThe surplus that remained after meeting the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution as bonus\tRatio of the decision\nIt is therefore clear that the claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as a result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the industrial concern has earned profits\tRatio of the decision\nIf in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss there is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus\tRatio of the decision\nBonus is not a deferred wage\tRatio of the decision\nBecause if it were so it would necessarily rank for precedence before dividends' The dividends can only be paid out of profits and unless and until profits are made no occasion or question can also arise for distribution of any sum as bonus amongst the employees\tRatio of the decision\nIf the industrial concern has resulted in a trading loss, there would be no profits of the particular year available for distribution of dividends, much less could the employees claim the distribution of bonus during that year\tRatio of the decision\nThis has been clearly recognised even in the various decisions of the Labour Appellate Tribunal, e.g., Nizam Sugar Factory Ltd., Hyderabad v. Their Workmen, (1952\tRatio of the decision\nI L.L.J. 386; Textile Mills, Madhya Pradesh v. Their Workmen, (1952) 2 L.L.J. 625;and Famous Cine Laboratory v. Their Workmen, (1953\tRatio of the decision\nI\tRatio of the decision\nL.L.J. 466;This was also the basis of the demand of the respondent in the case before us, its case being that the appellant had reaped substantial profits during the year 1949\tRatio of the decision\nThis case was negatived by the Industrial Court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal, both of whom held that the working of the appellant during the year 1949 had resulted in a loss\tFacts\nWhereas the Industrial Court declined to grant the respondent any relief because the working of the appellant during the year had resulted in a loss, the Labour Appellate Tribunal made a special case for the respondent in spite of its concurrence with that finding of the Industrial Court\tFacts\nIt is significant to observe that this principle was accepted by the Labour Appellate Tribunal itself\tFacts\nAs at present advised a claim for bonus which had been rested on profits earned should ordinarily be determined on the basis of the profits earned in the year under claim and that the scale of bonus should be determined on the quantum of profits earned in the year\tRuling by Lower Court\nSo, it would follow that if there is trading loss in the year under claim, bonus should not ordinarily be awarded\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt however observed: \" But, in our opinion, that should not be the universal rule\tRuling by Lower Court\nConsiderations of social justice cannot be disregarded altogether, in relations between capital and labour\tRuling by Lower Court\nThere may be special cases, and we consider the case before us to be one, where social justice would demand that labour should have bonus for the year where for that very year capital had not only a.. reasonable return but much in excess of that\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe Labour Appellate Tribunal did not accept the contention of the respondent that bonus should be linked to dividends nor did it rest its decision on the respondent having a right, title and interest in the reserves and the undistributed profits of the appellant\tFacts\nLinking of bonus to dividend would obviously create difficulties\tFacts\nBecause if that theory was accepted a company would not declare any dividends but accumulate the profits, build up reserves and distribute those profits in the shape of bonus shares or reduce the capital in which event the workers would not be entitled to claim anything as and by way of bonus\tRatio of the decision\nThe workers not being members of the company would also not have any right, title and interest in the reserves or the undistributed profits which would form part of the assets of the company\tRatio of the decision\nEven on a winding up of a company the property of the company would be applied in satisfaction of its liabilities pari passu and, unless the articles of association of the company otherwise provided, in distribution amongst the members according to their rights and interest in the company\tRatio of the decision\nThe employees would in no event be entitled to any share or interest in the assets and the capital of the company\tRatio of the decision\nA transfer of moneys from these reserves or the undistributed profits would therefore not enure for the benefit of the workers\tRatio of the decision\nThe shareholders only would be entitled to such benefit and the mere fact that dividends were declared and paid to the shareholders out of such reserves and undistributed profits would not entitle the workers to demand bonus when in fact the working of the industrial concern during the particular year had showed a loss\tRatio of the decision\nIt has also got to be remembered that the labour force employed in an industrial concern is a fluctuating body and it cannot be predicated of the labour force in a particular year that it represents the past and the present workers, so that it can claim to demand bonus out of the reserves or undistributed profits of the Previous years\tRatio of the decision\nOn the accounts of each year being made up and the profits of the industrial concern being ascertained the workers during the particular year have their demand for bonus fully satisfied out of the surplus profits and the balance of profits is allocated and carried over in the accounts\tRatio of the decision\nNo further claimed payment of bonus out of those reserves or undistributed profits can therefore survive\tRatio of the decision\nTo admit the claim for bonus out of the reserves transferred to the profit and loss account would tantamount to allowing a second bonus on the same profits in respect of which the workers had already received their full bonus in the previous year\tRatio of the decision\nThe labour force which earns the profits of a particular year by collaborating with the employers is distinct from the one which contributed to the profits of the previous years and there is no continuity between the labour forces which are employed in the industrial concern during the several years\tRatio of the decision\nThe ratio which applies in the case of the shareholders who acquire the right, title and interest of their predecessorsin-interest does not apply to the labour force and the fact that the shareholders get a dividend by transfer of funds from the reserves and undistributed profits of the previous years would not entitle the workers to demand bonus out of those funds if the working of the industrial concern during the particular year has resulted in a trading loss\tRatio of the decision\nThe considerations of social justice imported by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in arriving at the decision in favour of the respondent were not only irrelevant but untenable\tRatio of the decision\nSocial justice is a very vague and indeterminate expression and no clear-cut definition can be laid down which will cover all the situations\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Isaacs, the learned counsel for the respondent\tArgument\nattempted to give a definition in the following terms : \"social justice connotes the balance of adjustments of the various interests concerned in the social and economic structure of the State, in order to promote harmony upon an ethical and economic basis\" and he stated that there were three parties concerned here, viz\tArgument\nthe employers, the labour and the State itself, and the conception of social justice had to be worked out in this context\tArgument\nWithout embarking upon a discussion as to the exact connotation of the expression \"social justice\" we may only observe that the concept of social justice does not emanate from the fanciful notions of any particular adjudicator but must be founded on a more solid foundation\tArgument\nIndeed the Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal evolved the abovequoted formula with a view to dispensing social justice between the various parties concerned\tFacts\nIt adopted the following method of approach at page 1258 of that judgment :- \"Our approach to this problem is motivated by the requirement that we should ensure and achieve industrial peace which is essential for the development and expansion of industry\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis can be achieved by having a contented labour force on the one hand, and on the other hand an investing public who would be attracted to the industry by a steady and progressive return on capital which the, industry may be able to offer\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis formula was reiterated in Textile Mills, M. P\tPrecedent\nTheir Workmen, (1952) 2 L.L.J. 625; and Famous Cine Laboratory v. Their Workmen, (1953) 1 L.L.J. 466; and in the latter case it deprecated the idea of adjudicators importing considerations of social justice which were not comprised in that formula :- \"And what is social justice\tPrecedent\nSocial justice is not the fancy of any individual adjudicator; if it were so then ideas of social justice might vary from adjudicator to adjudicator over all parts of India\tPrecedent\nIn our Full Bench decision (See 1950, 2 L.L.J. 1247), we carefully considered the question of social justice in relation to bonus, and there we equated the rights and liabilities of employers and workmen with a view to achieving a just formula for the computation of bonus\tPrecedent\nThat Full Bench decision stands, and this tribunal and all other tribunals are bound by it\tPrecedent\nWithout committing ourselves to the acceptance of the above formula in its entirety we may point out that the Labour Appellate Tribunal did not apply its own formula to the facts of the present case\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also significant to note that even while importing considerations of social justice the Labour Appellate Tribunal was oblivious of the fact that it was by their own acts of indiscipline and strike that the workers of the appellant company themselves contributed, to the trading losses incurred by the appellant and it hardly lay in their mouth then to contend that they were none the less entitled to a payment of bonus commensurate with the dividend paid to the shareholders out of the undistributed profits of the previous years\tRatio of the decision\nThe Labour Appellate Tribunal also overlooked the fact that but for the Public Companies (Limitation of Dividend\tRatio of the decision\nOrdinance of 1948 the whole of the profits of 1948 could have been distributed after paying the workers bonus in that year of four annas in the rupee\tRatio of the decision\nWe may before concluding refer to an argument which was addressed to us by Mr. Isaacs, the learned counsel for the respondent, that this Court under article 136 should not interfere with the decisions of the tribunals set up by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947\tRatio of the decision\nThis contention can be shortly answered by referring to our decision in Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi v. Employees of the Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi, (1950] S.C.R. 459 1950 Indlaw SC 48; where we held that the Industrial Tribunals were tribunals within the meaning of article 136 and further that article 136 has vested in this, Court exceptional and overriding power to interfere where it reaches the conclusion that a person has been dealt with arbitrarily or that a Court or tribunal within the territory of India has not given a fair deal to a litigant\tRatio of the decision\nVide Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal 1954 Indlaw SC 213\tRatio of the decision\nThe result therefore is that the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal appealed against must be reversed and that of the Industrial Court (Textiles and Hosiery), Kanpur, restored\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeal will accordingly be allowed with costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

Man,Grade 'A' under Station Superintendent,South Central Railway,Tanuku from December,1995 to June,1997.In June,1997,due to excess staff at Tanuku\tFacts\nhe was instructed to report at Head Quarters,Vijayawada and accordingly,when he reported there,he was asked to go back to Tanuku\tFacts\nThereafter,he went back to Tanuku from where he was subsequently transferred to Rajahmundry\tFacts\nThereafter,PW-1 made a representation to his senior officer requesting him for posting at Vijayawada,Cheerala,Vetapalam or Tenali\tFacts\nLater,PW-1 was transferred to Vijayawada\tFacts\nc\tRatio of the decision\nAs the appellant-accused was dealing with the transfers,the complainant (PW-1) met him on 05.11.1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order\tFacts\nThe appellant-accused asked him to come on 10.11.1997.When he met him on 10.11.1997,the appellant asked him to come on the next day as he was busy in pay-fixation work\tFacts\nOn 11.11.1997,again he went to the office of the appellant but he could not find him on his seat\tFacts\nAgain a day after i.e.on\tFacts\n13.11.1997,when he met the appellant-accused,he informed him that his request for transfer has been processed and the order is ready and the same has been placed before the A.P.O.for signature and asked him to come on the next day,i.e.,on

Investigation (in short 'the CBI),Vijayawada\tFacts\nOn 14.11.1997,a trap was laid by the CBI officials along with panchas and when the accused demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.200/-as illegal gratification,he was caught red handed along with the money which was recovered from the right hand side pocket of his pant\tFacts\ne\tRatio of the decision\nOn 15.11.1997,at 7.30 a.m.,an FIR was registered by the Inspector,CBI,Visakhapatnam Branch in Crime No.RC 20(A)/97-VSP.After recording the statements of the witnesses,Inspector of Police,CBI,Visakhapatnam filed charge sheet being No.2/98-YTR dated 29.04.1998 against the appellant-accused for an offence punishable under Sections 7,13(1)(d)(ii) read with S.13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") in the Court of Special Judge for CBI Cases at Visakhapatnam\tFacts\nf\tRatio of the decision\nThe Special Judge,CBI,by order dated 19.03.2001,convicted the appellant and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-and,in default,to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable u/s.7 of the Act and one

petition before this Court\tFacts\nHeard Mr\tFacts\nATM Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr\tFacts\nHarish Chandra,learned senior counsel for the respondent\tFacts\nNotice only on quantum of sentence-hearing on all aspects\tFacts\nPermissibility\tRatio of the decision\nOn 28.01.2008,this Court consisting of three Hon'ble Judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum of sentence only\tFacts\nIn pursuance of the same,we permitted Mr\tFacts\nRangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant to address his arguments confining to quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant-accused\tFacts\nAs stated in the narration of facts,the appellant was convicted u/s.7 of the Act for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-,in default,simple imprisonment for one month\tFacts\nHe was also convicted for the offence under S.13(1)(d)(ii) read with S.13(2) of the Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous

said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the High Court\tFacts\nIf we confine ourselves to the limited extent of notice dated 28.01.2008,we have to hear both sides only on the quantum of sentence\tFacts\nHowever,Mr.Rangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this Court in Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt vs\tArgument\nState of Gujarat,(2011) 6 SCC 312 2011 Indlaw SC 370,submitted that in spite of limited notice,this Court,while exercising jurisdiction u/art.142 of the Constitution,in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial Court and the High Court\tArgument\nIn the reported case,the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u/s.302 IPC and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life\tArgument\nAt the SLP stage,this Court,by order dated 27.07.2009,issued notice confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was guilty of commission of an offence under any of the parts of S.304 Indian Penal Code,1860 (in short 'IPC') and not u/s.302 IPC.Similar request was made before the Bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case\tArgument\nThis Court,referred to the Supreme Court Rules,1966 which have been framed u/art.145 of the Constitution and also considered scope of its power u/art.142 as well as Order 47\tArgument\nRule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908\tArgument\nin short 'the Code).While deciding the said question,the Bench has also considered the scope of S.100 of the Code for entertaining the second appeal\tArgument\nIt further shows that the Court considered the plea of the appellant therein for acquittal despite the fact that the notice was limited in terms of the order dated 27.07.2009.It is relevant to point out that the Bench in para 18,clarified the position and reopened the case in its entirety even though notice was issued confining to a particular aspect\tArgument\nAfter permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits,it observed: \" .......We,however,make it clear that this cannot be a universal practice in all cases\tArgument\nThe question whether the Court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case\tArgument\nSince in the facts of this case,we find that the appellant should be heard on all points,we have come to the aforesaid conclusion\tArgument\nEmphasis supplied\tStatute\nIt is clear that the Bench itself has clarified that they are not laying down the law that in spite of issuing notice confining to a particular aspect (in the case on hand -\"quantum of sentence\") the parties are entitled to urge all points and re-open the case as if they are free to do the same without any restriction\tRatio of the decision\nAs a matter of fact,the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case,they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case on hand,it is to be noted that on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence led in by the prosecution and the defence and on appreciation of entire materials,the court of first instance i.e.the trial Court convicted the appellant and sentenced him as mentioned above\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court,as an appellate Court,once again analysed all the material,discussed the oral and documentary evidence and finding that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt concurred with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court and dismissed the appeal of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nInasmuch as both the courts have thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with reference to the charges leveled against the appellant and in view of the limited order dated 28.01.2008 by this Court issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even applying the analogy enunciated in Yomeshbhai 2011 Indlaw SC 370 (supra),we feel that it is not a case of such nature that the appellant should be heard on all points,consequently,we reject the request of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nQuantum of sentence\tRatio of the decision\nWhether requires any reduction\tRatio of the decision\nMr\tArgument\nRangaramanujam,learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that inasmuch as the alleged incident took place on 14.11.1997 and 14 years have elapsed since then,the amount of Rs.200/-said to have been received by the appellant is trivial in nature and also of the fact that due to the said conviction and sentence he lost his job,leniency may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone\tArgument\nHe fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year,the appellant had served only 52 days in prison\tArgument\nWith this factual position,let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone\tArgument\nIt is not in dispute that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14.11.1997 i.e.subsequent to the Act\tRatio of the decision\nS.7 of the Act relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act\tRatio of the decision\nIf the said offence/charge is proved,the court has no other option but to impose sentence of imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and also liable to fine\tRatio of the decision\nThe said section reads as under:- \" Public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.-Whoever,being,or expecting to be a public servant,accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person,for himself or for any other person,any gratification whatever,other than legal remuneration,as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show,in the exercise of his official functions,favour or disfavor to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person,with the Central Government or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any State or with any local authority,corporation or Government company referred to in Cl.(c) of Section 2,or with any public servant,whether named or otherwise shall,be punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine.........\" (Emphasis supplied\tStatute\nS.13 deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant\tStatute\nAs per sub-s.(2) if any public servant commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine\tStatute\nFor clarity,we reproduce the said section hereunder: \" Criminal misconduct by a public servant.-(1\tStatute\nA public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct, (a) If he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in Section 7; or (b) If he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person,any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been,or to be,or to be likely to he concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by him or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate,or from any,person whom he knows to be interests in or related to the person so concerned; or (c\tStatute\nIf he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do; or (d\tStatute\nIf he,- (i\tStatute\nBy corrupt or illegal means,obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or Pecuniary advantage; or (ii) By abusing his position as a public servant,obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage; or (iii\tStatute\nWhile holding office as a public servant,obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest; or (e) If he or any person on his behalf,is in possession or has,at any time during the Period of his office,been in possession for which the public servant cannot satisfactorily account,of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income\tStatute\nExplanation\tStatute\nFor the purposes of this section \"known sources of income\" means income received from any lawful source and such receipt has been intimated in accordance,with the provisions of any law,rules or orders for the time being applicable to public servant\tStatute\nAny public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine\tStatute\nIt is useful to refer that in the Prevention of Corruption Act,1947 the same \"criminal misconduct\" which is available in S.13 of the 1988 Act had been dealt with in S.5 of the 1947 Act\tStatute\nS.5(2) of the 1947 Act mandates that any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine\tStatute\nHowever,proviso to sub-s.(2) of S.5 gives power to the court that for any special reasons to be recorded in writing,impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year\tStatute\nSuch relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 Act\tStatute\nTo put it clear,in the 1988 Act,if an offence u/s.7 is proved,the same is punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months and in the case of Section 13,it shall not be less than one year\tStatute\nNo other interpretation is permissible\tStatute\nOther circumstances pleaded for reduction of sentence\tRatio of the decision\nIn order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the above,learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this Court in Bechaarbhai S.Prajapati vs\tArgument\nState of Gujarat,(2008) 11 SCC 163 2008 Indlaw SC 297 and based on the same requested this Court to modify the sentence to the extent of period already undergone\tArgument\nWe have gone through the facts in that case\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that even in the cited decision,the appellant accused demanded only Rs.250/-and it was paid and accepted\tRatio of the decision\nFinally,the Special Judge framed charges for offence punishable under Sections 7,12,13(1)(d) read with S.13(2) of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant therein was convicted for offence u/s.7(2) of the Act and appeal before the High Court was also dismissed\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter,the same was challenged before this Court\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court,after holding that the conclusion of the trial Court and High Court does not suffer from any infirmity considered the alternative submission which related to harshness of sentence\tRatio of the decision\nIn that case,taking note of the fact that the occurrence took place nearly seven years back and also of the fact that the appellant had suffered custody for more than six months,considering all these aspects,while maintaining the conviction,this Court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone\tRatio of the decision\nSince the appellant therein was convicted only u/s.7 and S.161 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nPC.,the minimum sentence being six months and of the fact that he had suffered custody for more than six months,the course adopted by this Court is perfectly in order and the same cannot be applied to the case on hand,wherein the appellant had undergone only 52 days when the minimum sentence was six months u/s.7 and one year u/s.13\tRatio of the decision\nLearned senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that inasmuch as the incident had occurred on 14.11.1997 and the trial Court has convicted him on 19.03.2001 which was affirmed by the High Court on 03.10.2007,at this juncture,i.e.,after a gap of 14 years,there is no need to retain the same sentence and the Court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time\tArgument\nThere is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nInasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this Court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u/ss.7 and 13 of the Act,we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases,the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence\tRatio of the decision\nAccordingly,we reject the said contention\tRatio of the decision\nIt was further contended that the amount alleged to have been received by the appellant accused is only Rs.200/-and he also lost his job after conviction by the trial court\tArgument\nThough,these grounds may be attractive in respect of other offences where minimum sentence is not prescribed,in view of our reasonings in the earlier paras,the same cannot be applied to the case on hand\tRatio of the decision\nAbout the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job,undergone the ordeal all along etc.a lenient view be taken in this case,it is useful to refer decision of this Court in State of M.P.vs\tPrecedent\nShambhu Dayal\tPrecedent\nNagar,(2006) 8 SCC 693 2006\tPrecedent\nIndlaw SC 716 wherein it was held that: \" It is difficult to accept the prayer of the respondent that a lenient view be taken in this case\tPrecedent\nThe corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem\tPrecedent\nIt has spread everywhere\tPrecedent\nNo facet of public activity has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption\tPrecedent\nIt has deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country\tPrecedent\nLarge-scale corruption retards the nation-building activities and everyone has to suffer on that count\tPrecedent\nAs has been aptly observed in Swatantar Singh v\tPrecedent\nState of Haryana,(1997) 4 SCC 14 1997 Indlaw SC 1061,corruption is corroding,like cancerous lymph nodes,the vital veins of the body politics,social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers\tPrecedent\nThe efficiency in public service would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently,truthfully,honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post\tPrecedent\nThe reputation of corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoriety much faster than the smoke\tPrecedent\nArt.142 and its applicability\tPrecedent\nBy drawing our attention to Art.142 of the Constitution of India,learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice,this Court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this Court\tArgument\nSimilar claim based on Art.142 has been negatived in several decisions by this Court,we need to refer only the latest decision of this Court in Manish Goel vs\tPrecedent\nRohini Goel,(2010) 4 SCC 393 2010 Indlaw SC 301.The facts in that case are that the parties by persuasion of the family members and friends,entered into a compromise and prepared a memorandum of understanding dated 13.11.2009,in the proceedings pending before the Mediation Centre,Delhi,by which they agreed on terms and conditions incorporated therein,to settle all their disputes and also for dissolution of their marriage\tPrecedent\nThe parties filed an application under Section 13-B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 before the Family Court,Delhi seeking divorce by mutual consent\tPrecedent\nThe said HMA No.456 of 2009 came before the court and it recorded the statement of parties on 16.11.2009.The parties moved another HMA No.457 of 2009 to waive the statutory period of six months in filing the second petition\tPrecedent\nHowever,the court rejected the said application vide order dated 01.12.2009 observing that the court was not competent to waive the required statutory period of six months under the Act and such a waiver was permissible only under the directions of the Supreme Court as held by this Court in Anil Kumar Jain vs\tPrecedent\nMaya Jain,(2009\tPrecedent\n10 SCC 415 2009 Indlaw SC 1494.Hence the parties have approached this Court for appropriate

paras,which are useful,may be quoted: \" We are fully alive of the fact that this Court has been exercising the power u/art.142 of the Constitution for dissolution of marriage where the Court finds that marriage is totally unworkable,emotionally dead,beyond salvage and has broken down irretrievably,even if the facts of the case do not provide a ground in law on which the divorce could be

v\tPrecedent\nPuneet Kishore (2002) 10 SCC 194 2001 Indlaw SC 21204,this Court while allowing a transfer petition directed the court concerned to decide the case of divorce by mutual consent,ignoring the statutory requirement of moving the motion after expiry of the period of six months under Section 13-B(2) of the Act\tPrecedent\nIn Anil Kumar Jain,this Court held that an order of waiving the statutory requirements can be passed only by this Court in exercise of its powers u/art.142 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nThe said power is not vested with any other court\tPrecedent\nHowever,we have also noticed various judgments of this Court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing,exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature,which is not permissible in law (vide Chetan Dass v\tPrecedent\nKamla Devi (2001) 4 SCC 250 2001 Indlaw SC 20206 and Vishnu Dutt

2003 Indlaw SC 1504\tPrecedent\nthis Court held as under: \" ...sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right\tPrecedent\ndespite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in Art.142 of the Constitution of India,this Court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision\tPrecedent\nIn Laxmidas Morarji v\tPrecedent\nBehrose Darab Madan (2009) 10 SCC 425 2009 Indlaw SC 1154,while dealing with the provisions of Art.142 of the Constitution,this Court has held as under:\tPrecedent\nThe power u/art.142 of the Constitution is a constitutional power and hence,not restricted by statutory enactments\tPrecedent\nThough the Supreme Court would not pass any order u/art.142 of the Constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject,at the same time these constitutional powers cannot in any way,be controlled by any statutory provisions\tPrecedent\nHowever,it is to be made clear that this power cannot be used to supplant the law applicable to the case\tPrecedent\nThis means that acting under Article 142,the Supreme Court cannot pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case\tPrecedent\nThe power is to be used sparingly in cases which cannot be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law or when the existing provisions of law cannot bring about complete justice between the parties\tPrecedent\nEmphasis added\tPrecedent\nAfter elaborately discussing almost all the case laws on this subject about jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142,summarised the same in the following words: Therefore,the law in this regard can be summarised to the effect that in exercise of the power u/art.142 of the Constitution,this Court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy\tRatio of the decision\nAfter saying so,the Court rejected the request of the parties to waive the statutory period of six months under the Act\tRatio of the decision\nIn Mota Ram vs\tPrecedent\nState of Haryana,(2009) 12 SCC 727 2009 Indlaw SC 682,this Court,while reiterating the above principles has concluded that Art.142 cannot be exercised to negate the statutory provisions\tPrecedent\nIn Academy of Nutrition Improvement and Others vs\tPrecedent\nUnion of India,JT 2011 (8) SC 16 2011 Indlaw SC 515,the following conclusion about the applicability of Art.142 is relevant\tPrecedent\nThe question is having held that Rule 44I to be invalid,whether we can permit the continuation of the ban on sale of non-iodised salt for human consumption for any period\tPrecedent\nArt.142 of the Constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice,if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law\tPrecedent\nIn Supreme Court Bar Association v\tPrecedent\nUnion of India: 1998 (4) SCC 409\tPrecedent\n1998 Indlaw SC 688,this Court observed: The Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction u/art.142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice \"between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it\".The very nature of the power must lead the court to set limits for itself within which to exercise those powers and ordinarily it cannot disregard a statutory provision governing a subject,except perhaps to balance the equities between the conflicting claims of the litigating parties by \"ironing out the creases\" in a cause or matter before it\tPrecedent\nIndeed this Court is not a court of restricted jurisdiction of only dispute settling\tPrecedent\nIt is well recognised and established that this Court has always been a law maker and its role travels beyond merely dispute settling\tPrecedent\nIt is a \"problem solver in the nebulous areas\".(See\tPrecedent\nK.Veeraswami v\tPrecedent\nUnion of India : 1991 (3) SCC 655 1991 Indlaw SC\tPrecedent\n711,but the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject matter of a given case,cannot be altogether ignored by this Court,while making an order u/art.142.Indeed,these constitutional powers can not,in any way,be controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same time these powers are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject\tPrecedent\nIn Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v\tPrecedent\nRajesh Ranjan : 2005 (3\tPrecedent\nSCC 284 2005 Indlaw SC 93,this Court after reiterating that this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction u/art.142 of the Constitution would not pass any order which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable to the case or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject,observed as follows\tPrecedent\nIt may therefore be understood that the plenary powers of this Court u/art.142 of the Constitution are inherent in the Court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the Court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes .These\tPrecedent\npowers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties...and are in the nature of supplementary powers\tPrecedent\nand] may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice\tPrecedent\nThe advantage that is derived from a constitutional provision couched in such a wide compass is that it prevents 'clogging or obstruction of the stream of justice\tPrecedent\nSee: Supreme Court Bar Association 1998 Indlaw SC 688 (supra\tPrecedent\nThough the jurisdiction of this Court,u/art.142 of the Constitution of India is not in dispute,we make it clear that exercise of such power would,however,depend on the facts and circumstances of each case\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court,in exercise of its jurisdiction,u/s.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and this Court\tRatio of the decision\nu/art.142 of the Constitution,would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly\tRatio of the decision\nwhen both the trial Court as also the High Court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the Act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence\tRatio of the decision\nFinally,learned senior counsel for the appellant has cited certain orders of this Court wherein this Court has reduced the period of sentence already undergone while upholding the conviction\tArgument\nWe have perused those orders\tRatio of the decision\nThe orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged/convicted and minimum sentence,if any,as available in the Act as well as the period already undergone\tRatio of the decision\nIn the absence of such details,we are unable to rely on those orders\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which we are concerned,the following principles emerge: \"a) When the Court issues notice confining to particular aspect/sentence,arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance/material is shown to the Court for arguing the matter on all aspects\tRatio of the decision\nLong delay in disposal of appeal or any other factor may not be a ground for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the statute prescribes minimum sentence\tRatio of the decision\nIn other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed,it is open to the Court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision\tRatio of the decision\nIn a case of corruption by public servant,quantum of amount is immaterial\tRatio of the decision\nUltimately it depends upon the conduct of the delinquent and the proof regarding demand and acceptance established by the prosecution\tRatio of the decision\nMerely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the Act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence,particularly,when the Statute prescribes minimum sentence\tRatio of the decision\nThough Art.142 of the Constitution gives wider power to this Court,waiver of certain period as prescribed in the Statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible\tRatio of the decision\nAn order,which this Court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties,must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution,but also it cannot even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant Statute\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,this Court cannot altogether ignore the substantive provisions of a Statute\tRatio of the

            "text": "The appellant is a company incorporated under the Companies Act,1956 with the object of manufacture and sale of cigarettes\tFacts\nMembers of general public are the shareholders and the shares of the company are traded in through various stock exchanges in the country\tFacts\nA petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution by respondent No.1 seeking for a writ of mandamus to treat the members of the respondent-union who are employees working in the canteen of the appellants factory as employees of the appellant and for grant of monetary and other consequential benefits\tFacts\nThe canteen is provided in the factory premises of the appellant pursuant to Section 46 of the Factories Act,1948 [hereinafter referred to as the Act],which obliges a factory employing more than 250 workmen to provide such a canteen\tStatute\nOn behalf of the respondents,it is contended that the appellant had been managing the canteen up to the year 1982 and thereafter introduced the contract system for maintaining the canteen so established; that though the management of the canteen had been entrusted to the contractors from time to time,the personnel employed in the canteen were retained by all the contractors and they have been paid salaries through contractors; that the workmen employed in the canteen have been provided with ESI benefits under the Code No.VST,the appellant,and benefits arising under the Employees Provident Funds Act are also provided similarly; that the appellant has also provided a building along with furniture,utensils,cutlery,gas,electricity,water supply and other facilities; that the contractor is engaged only to prepare the food and serve it to the employees and that the quality of the food and the rates are controlled by the management of the appellant\tArgument\nOn behalf of the appellant,contention was raised that no writ would lie against the appellant inasmuch as the appellant is a company,which is not an authority or a person against whom a writ would lie\tArgument\nIt was submitted that they do not discharge any public duty and hence the writ cannot be issued\tArgument\nOn the merits of the matter,the appellant disputed various questions of fact and urged that the decision of this Court in Parimal Chandra Raha vs\tArgument\nLife Insurance Corporation of India,1995 Supp.(2) SCC 611 1995 Indlaw SC 183,would not be applicable to the appellant in the facts and circumstances of the case\tArgument\nThe learned Single Judge,who decided the matter in the first instance,held that a writ would lie against a company under a private management following the decision in T.Gattaiah vs\tFacts\nCommissioner of Labour,1981 [II ] LLJ 54 1981 Indlaw AP 26,in which it was held that establishment of a canteen and its maintenance is a statutory requirement; under Section 46 of the Act a public duty is imposed on the company to establish and maintain the canteen; inasmuch as members of the respondent-union are working in the canteen they are entitled to seek a mandamus\tFacts\nHe,therefore,held that when a public duty is called upon to be discharged by a private management,a writ of mandamus would lie and could be issued under Article 226 of the Constitution\tFacts\nHe thus rejected the contention\tFacts\nOn the merits of the matter,the learned Single Judge followed the decision in Parimal Chandra Rahas case holding that when the duty had been enjoined on the appellant to provide and maintain a canteen facility under the Factories Act it becomes the obligation of the appellant to establish a canteen and that is what the appellant had done\tPrecedent\nTherefore,when that work is got done through somebody else by providing the necessary infrastructure and other facilities,when the personnel did not change though the contractors changed from time to time,he held that they become employees of the appellant\tPrecedent\nOn that basis the learned Single Judge granted reliefs sought for by the respondents,however,imposing certain restrictions with regard to the age,being medically fit,on the date of the writ petition,had put in a minimum of three years of continuous service and such service prior to the attainment of the minimum qualifying age under the company should be ignored\tFacts\nOn appeal,the Division Bench of the High Court affirmed the view taken by the learned Single Judge\tFacts\nThe Division Bench referred to their decision in Rakesh Gupta vs\tFacts\nHyderabad Stock Exchange Ltd\tFacts\nHyderabad & Ors.,AIR 1996 AP 430 1996 Indlaw AP\tFacts\n302,that a writ in the nature of mandamus,certiorari and prohibition are recognised as public law remedies and are not available to enforce private law rights\tFacts\nHowever,noticing that the expression any person or authority used in Article 226 of the Constitution should not be confined only to statutory authorities and instrumentalities of State but would cover any other person or body performing public duty\tFacts\nThe form of the body concerned is not very much relevant\tPrecedent\nWhat is relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on that body\tPrecedent\nThe duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the affected party,no matter by what means the duty is imposed\tFacts\nOn that basis,the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the writ appeal\tFacts\nHence this appeal\tFacts\nOn behalf of the appellant contention put forth at the forefront is that a writ would not lie against the appellant inasmuch as the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and as an incident thereto has provided a canteen to its workmen pursuant to an obligation under Section 46 of the Act\tArgument\nShri S.Ganesh,learned counsel for the appellant,pressed into service the decision of this Court in Anadi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Survarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust & Ors.vs\tArgument\nV.R.Rudani & Ors.,1989 (2) SCC 691 1989\tArgument\nIndlaw SC 589,to contend that mere running of a factory to manufacture and sell of cigarettes can never be considered to be a public duty much less an incident thereto such as providing a canteen to its workmen\tArgument\nOn behalf of the respondent,heavy reliance was placed on this decision and also the decision of the High Court in T.Gattaiahs case,to contend that in running a canteen under Section 46 of the Act,the appellant was discharging a public duty and,therefore,a writ of mandamus would lie against it\tArgument\nn Anadi Muktas case,the contention,similar to the present case,had been raised\tPrecedent\nWrit petitioners were seeking for a writ of mandamus to put them back in the college and they were claiming only a terminal benefit or arrears of salary payable to them\tPrecedent\nIn that background,it was observed that if the rights are purely of a private character no mandamus could be issued and also,if the management of the college were purely a private body with no public duty mandamus would not lie\tPrecedent\nIn that case,the respondent was managing the affiliated college to which public money is paid as Government aid which played a major role in the control,maintenance and working of educational institutions\tPrecedent\nThe aided institutions,it was noticed,like Government institutions discharge public function by way of imparting education to students\tPrecedent\nThey were subject to the rules and regulations of the affiliating University and their activities were closely supervised by the University authorities\tPrecedent\nEmployment in such institutions,therefore,is not devoid of any public character inasmuch as the service conditions of the academic staff were controlled by the University particularly in regard to their pay scales and the protection by University decisions creating a legal right or duty relationship between the staff and the management\tPrecedent\nWhen there is existence of such relationship mandamus could not be refused to such an aggrieved party\tPrecedent\nIt was further explained in that decision that the term authority used in Article 226 of the Constitution should receive a liberal meaning unlike the term in Article 12,which is only for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights under Article 32.The words any person or authority used in Article 226 are,therefore,not be confined only to statutory authorities or instrumentalities of the State but would cover any other person or body performing public duty\tPrecedent\nThe duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the affected party,no matter by what means the duty is imposed,if a positive obligation exists,mandamus cannot be denied\tPrecedent\nIn De Smith,Woolf and Jowells Judicial Review of Administrative Action,5th Edn.,it is noticed that not all the Activities of the private bodies are subject to private law,e.g.,the Activities by private bodies may be governed by the standards of public law when its decisions are subject to duties conferred by statute or when,by virtue of the function it is performing or possibly its dominant position in the market,it is under an implied duty to act in the public interest\tRatio of the decision\nBy way of illustration,it is noticed that a private company selected to run a prison although motivated by commercial profit should be regarded,at least in relation to some of its activities,as subject to public law because of the nature of the function it is performing\tRatio of the decision\nThis is because the prisoners,for whose custody and care it is responsible,are in the prison in consequence of an order of the court,and the purpose and nature of their detention is a matter of public concern and interest\tRatio of the decision\nAfter detailed discussion,the learned authors have summarized the position with the following propositions: (1) The test of whether a body is performing a public function,and is hence amenable to judicial review,may not depend upon the source of its power or whether the body is ostensibly a public or a private body\tRatio of the decision\n2) The principles of judicial review prima facie govern the Activities of bodies performing public functions\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of their public functions are the subject matter of judicial review\tRatio of the decision\nIn the following two situations judicial review will not normally be appropriate even though the body may be performing a public function: (a) Where some other branch of the law more appropriately governs the dispute between the parties\tRatio of the decision\nIn such a case,that branch of the law and its remedies should and normally will be applied; and (b) Where there is a contract between the litigants\tRatio of the decision\nIn such a case the express or implied terms of the agreement should normally govern the matter\tRatio of the decision\nThis reflects the normal approach of English law,namely,that the terms of a contract will normally govern the transaction,or other relationship between the parties,rather than the general law\tRatio of the decision\nThus,where a special method of resolving disputes (such as arbitration or resolution by private or domestic Tribunals) has been agreed by the parties (expressly or by necessary implication),that regime,and not judicial review,will normally govern the dispute\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court has relied very strongly on the decision of a learned Single Judge in T.Gattaiahs case wherein it was stated that a writ may lie under Article 226 of the Constitution against a company incorporated under the Companies Act,1956 as it is permissible to issue a writ against any person\tRatio of the decision\nPrima facie,therefore,a private person or an incorporated company cannot be taken out of the sweep and the contemplation of Article 226 of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nThat decision does not take note of the fact as to the nature of the functions that a person or an incorporated company should be performing to attract judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nIn Anadi Muktas case this Court examined the various aspects and the distinction between an authority and a person and after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came to the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the authority or the person performs a public function or discharges a public duty Article 226 of the Constitution can be invoked\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes\tRatio of the decision\nManufacture and sale of cigarettes will not involve any public function\tRatio of the decision\nIncidental to that activity there is an obligation under Section 46 of the Act to set up a canteen when the establishment has more than 250 workmen\tRatio of the decision\nThat means,it is a condition of service in relation to a workman providing better facilities to workmen to discharge their duties properly and maintain their own health or welfare\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,it is only a labour welfare device for the benefit of its work force unlike a provision where Pollution Control Act makes it obligatory even on a private company not to discharge certain effluents\tRatio of the decision\nIn such cases public duty is owed to the public in general and not specific to any person or group of persons\tRatio of the decision\nFurther the damage that would be caused in not observing them is immense\tRatio of the decision\nIf merely what can be considered a part of the conditions of service of a workman is violated then we do not think there is any justification to hold that such activity will amount to public duty\tRatio of the decision\nThus,we are of the view that the High Court fell into error that appellant is amenable to writ jurisdiction\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court in Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd.& Anr.vs\tRatio of the decision\nShramik Sena & Ors.,1999(6) SCC\tRatio of the decision\n439 1999 Indlaw SC 513,referred to the decisions in Parimal Chandra Rahas case,Reserve Bank of India vs\tRatio of the decision\nWorkmen,1996\tRatio of the decision\n3) SCC 267,and M.M.R.Khan vs\tRatio of the decision\nUnion of India,1990 Supp\tRatio of the decision\nSCC 191 1996 Indlaw SC 618,and held that the workmen of a statutory canteen,as in the present case,would be workmen of an establishment for the purposes of the Act only and not for other purposes\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter,this Court further examined whether the material on record would show that the workmen are employees of the management for all purposes and adopted some of the tests as follows\tRatio of the decision\nThe canteen has been there since the inception of the appellants factory\tFacts\nThe workmen have been employed for long years and despite a change of contractors the workers have continued to be employed in the canteen\tFacts\nThe premises,furniture,fixture,fuel,electricity,utensils,etc.have been provided for by the appellant\tFacts\nThe wages of the canteen workers have to be reimbursed by the appellant\tFacts\nThe supervision and control on the canteen is exercised by the appellant through its authorised officer,as can be seen from the various clauses of the contract between the appellant and the contractor\tFacts\nThe contractor is nothing but an agent or a manager of the appellant,who works completely under the supervision,control and directions of the appellant\tFacts\nThe workmen have the protection of continuous employment in the establishment\tFacts\nIn the present case,the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge on examination of the facts available is that there had been a canteen within the premises of the appellant up to the year 1982 and it is only from 1982 onwards the management of the canteen has been entrusted to a private contractor; that even after change of the contractor,the canteen workers have continued to be the same irrespective of the change in the contractors from time to time; that wages were paid to the workmen in the canteen by the management through the contractor; that the appellant has provided the accommodation,furniture,fuel,electricity,utensils,etc\tRatio of the decision\nthat the management exercises control over the standard in quality,quantity and the rate of the food items supplied to the workmen for whose benefit the canteen is established\tRatio of the decision\nThus,these circumstances clearly indicate that the appellant has a complete control over the Activities in respect of the canteen and the contractor has absolutely no discretion either in regard to the menu,quality and quantity of the food items much less the rate at which the same are supplied to the workmen\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the management of the appellant exercises such a complete control,the canteen shall be deemed to be run by the management itself\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant in any manner cannot controvert these facts\tRatio of the decision\nWe do agree that the respondents have a strong case on merits\tRatio of the decision\nSince we have held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution,we would have set aside the order made by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,in the special features of the case,although we do not agree with the High Court on the first question raised,we feel,after clarifying the legal position,that we should not disturb the decision given by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal,therefore,stands dismissed subject to what is stated in regard to writs to be issued by the High Court in respect of persons or authorities exercising public duty or otherwise\tRuling by Present Court\nNo costs\tRuling by Present Court\nCivil Appeal Nos.6533/97 & 6534/97\tRuling by Present Court\nIn these appeals,on a reference made on the question whether certain persons employed in the canteen should be treated as employees of the appellant and,if so,in what category they are to be fitted in and to what wages they are entitled to,the Industrial Tribunal,Hyderabad,[hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal] inquired into the matter\tRatio of the decision\nThe contesting respondents contended that the workmen in the canteen had been working right from its inception,that is,since 1967; that from 1976 onwards,after expiry of the contract with the Industrial Catering Services,they had been directly working with the appellant without any contractor; that they sought for regularization of their services by letter dated 28 February 1978; that the said letter was corrected and redrafted by the Personnel Manager to indicate the idea of floating an Association/Society to run the canteen; that this modified request contained in Ex.W-49 was stated to be contradictory to the stand taken by the workmen all through\tArgument\nThe Tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that the Personnel Manager modified Ex.W-50 and obtained Ex.W-49 in the modified form\tArgument\nThe Tribunal held against them,as there was no material to show that the management had discussed on each point and thereafter an agreement had been drafted\tFacts\nThe Tribunal recorded the findings that the canteen had been working for the benefit of the workmen within the premises provided by and with the equipment supplied by the appellant; that the appellant supplies the provisions for the preparation of foodstuffs; that the appellant issues token to the employees,who on production of the same obtain foodstuffs from the canteen; that the Committee appointed by the appellant decides the menu and as per the directions and supervision of the Catering Officer,the canteen functions; that the quality and quantity of the foodstuffs is supervised by him,who functions under the Committee\tFacts\nThe contributions like ESI,Provident Fund,etc.had also been categorically specified to be provided by the appellant and ESI code for the permanent establishment and for the present workmen was the same; that after the evidence was tendered by the workmen the appellant got the code changed and the appellant transferred the workmen from one place to another and that the amount to be surrendered by way of unpaid salaries had to be remitted back to the management\tFacts\nThus the Tribunal held that these facts clearly indicated that the appellant exercised administrative,financial and disciplinary control over the workmen in question\tFacts\nThe Tribunal held that no other material is required to hold them to be employees of the appellant\tFacts\nIn those circumstances,the Tribunal passed an award that these workmen should be treated as employees of the appellant and they are entitled to payment of appropriate scales and designations in terms of Ex.W12 and W14 from 1 April 1979 with all consequential and attendant benefits of arrears of pay,etc.together with counting of entire service for the purpose of terminal benefits\tFacts\nAgainst this award,a writ petition was filed before the High Court\tFacts\nThe High Court dismissed the same stating that it is covered by another matter\tFacts\nIt is unnecessary to examine the contention whether the matter is covered by a subsequent decision or not as the facts of the present case stand on its own\tFacts\nThe reference had been made to the Tribunal and adjudication had been made by the Tribunal as to the status of the workmen,the nature of employment,control exercised by the appellant,which leave no room for doubt that they are the employees of the appellant\tFacts\nA contention is also sought to be made that it is not possible to run a canteen in the refinery area\tArgument\nIt is contended that under the Petroleum Rules framed under the Petroleum Act,1934,there are certain hazardous areas where there cannot be a canteen as no fire,furnace,source of heat or light capable of igniting inflammable vapours shall be allowed except in the firing spaces or stills and boilers\tArgument\nHowever,there is no material on record to show that the canteen is located in such an area where it would be hazardous to have a fire,furnace,source of heat or light to cook food\tRatio of the decision\nIn the absence of such material,we find no substance in this contention\tRatio of the decision\nIt is brought to our notice that a fire had taken place on a tank on 14 September 1997 and that it was extinguished after 14 days,which severely damaged all the building including the canteen and that food and beverages being provided to its employees by making an arrangement to obtain the same from outside the premises of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThese facts are brought to our notice by an affidavit filed on 21 November 2000.But these factors do not come in the way of the award made by the Tribunal,as it is possible to locate the canteen in an appropriate place where there is no hazard of the kind envisaged under the Petroleum Rules\tRatio of the decision\nThis contention is also rejected\tRatio of the decision\nIn the circumstances aforesaid,the contention vis--vis the findings recorded by the Tribunal,we find absolutely no merit in these appeals and the same shall stand dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

view to establish their legal rights to enable the High Court to issue a writ of mandamus,the respondents were obligated to establish that the appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate adumbrated in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India\tRatio of the decision\nThey have not been able to show that any advertisement had been issued inviting applications from eligible candidates to fill up the said posts\tRatio of the decision\nIt has also not been shown that the vacancies had been notified to the employment exchange\tRatio of the decision\nThe

assuming that DPC would mean Selection Committee,there is noting on record to show who were its members and how and at whose instance it was constituted\tRatio of the decision\nThe Commissioner,as noticed hereinbefore,was the Chairman of the DPC.How the matter was referred to the DPC has not been disclosed\tRatio of the decision\nEven the affidavit affirmed by Shri Tayeng before the High Court in this behalf is silent\tRatio of the decision\nThe appointing authority,in absence of any delegation of power having been made in that behalf,was the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nThe Government Order dated 12.01.1998 did not delegate the power of appointment to the Commissioner\tRatio of the decision\nHe,therefore,was wholly incompetent to issue the appointment letters\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondents,therefore,in our opinion,were not entitled to hold the posts\tRatio of the decision\nIn a case of this nature,where the facts are admitted,the principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with,particularly when the same would result in futility\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that where appointments had been made by a competent authority or at least some steps have been taken in that behalf,the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with,in view of the decision of this Court in Murugayya Udayar 1991 Indlaw SC 904 (supra\tRatio of the decision\nWe,as noticed hereinbefore,do not know as to under what circumstances the orders of appointments were issued\tRatio of the decision\nThe said decision is not an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with in all situations\tRatio of the decision\nIn Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 1990 Indlaw SC 463 (supra),this Court was dealing with a question in regard to continuance of the Law Officers\tPrecedent\nThe question which arose herein was not raised\tPrecedent\nIt was held: \"34.In our opinion,the wide sweep of Art.14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the State of U.P.in exercise of its executive power,irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the Government Counsel in the districts and the other rights,contractual or statutory,which the appointees may have\tPrecedent\nIt is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right,available to the appointees,and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment,the impugned circular,issued in exercise of the executive power of the State,must satisfy Art.14 of the Constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary,it must be struck down\tPrecedent\nHowever,we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment,termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines,followed by the State of U.P.,for a long time\tPrecedent\nThis too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case\tPrecedent\n35.It is now too well settled that every State action,in order to survive,must not be susceptible to the vice of arbitrariness which is the crux of Art.14 of the Constitution and basic to the rule of law,the system which governs us\tPrecedent\nArbitrariness is the very negation of the rule of law\tPrecedent\nSatisfaction of this basic test in every State action is sine qua non to its validity and in this respect,the State cannot claim comparison with a private individual even in the field of contract\tPrecedent\nThis distinction between the State and a private individual in the field of contract has to be borne in the mind\tPrecedent\nWe in the facts and circumstances of this case do not see any arbitrariness on the part of the State in its action directing cancellation of appointments\tRatio of the decision\nWe may,on the other hand,notice that Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 1990 Indlaw SC 463 (supra) has been distinguished by this Court in State of U.P.and Others v\tPrecedent\nU.P.State Law Officers Association and Others [(1994) 2 SCC 204  1994 Indlaw SC 1289] stating: \"The reliance placed by the respondents in this behalf on Shrilekha Vidyarthi v\tPrecedent\nState of U.P.1990 Indlaw SC 463 is misplaced for the obvious reason that the decision relates to the appointment of the District Government Counsel and the Additional/Assistant District Government Counsel who are the law officers appointed by the State Government to conduct civil,criminal and revenue cases in any court other than the High Court\tPrecedent\nTheir appointments are made through open competition from among those who are eligible for appointment and strictly on the basis of merit as evidenced by the particulars of their practice,opinions of the District Magistrate and the District Judge and also after taking into consideration their character and conduct\tPrecedent\nTheir appointment is in the first instance for one year\tPrecedent\nIt is only after their satisfactory performance during that period that a deed of engagement is given to them,and even then the engagement is to be for a term not exceeding three years\tPrecedent\nThe renewal of their further term again depends upon the quality of work and conduct,capacity as a lawyer,professional conduct,public reputation in general,and character and integrity as certified by the District Magistrate and the District Judge\tPrecedent\nFor the said purpose,the District Magistrate and the District Judge are required to maintain a character roll and a record of the work done by the officer and the capacity displayed by him in discharge of the work\tPrecedent\nHis work is also subject to strict supervision\tPrecedent\nThe shortcomings in the work are required to be brought to the notice of the Legal Remembrancer\tPrecedent\nIt will thus be seen that the appointment of the two sets of officers,viz.,the Government Counsel in the High Court with whom we are concerned,and the District Government Counsel with whom the said decision was concerned,are made by dissimilar procedures\tPrecedent\nThe latter are not appointed as a part of the spoils system\tPrecedent\nHaving been selected on merit and for no other consideration,they are entitled to continue in their office for the period of the contract of their engagement and they can be removed only for valid reasons\tPrecedent\nThe people are interested in their continuance for the period of their contracts and in their non-substitution by those who may come in through the spoils system\tPrecedent\nIt is in these circumstances that this Court held that the wholesale termination of their services was arbitrary and violative of Art.14 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nThe ratio of the said decision can hardly be applied to the appointments of the law officers in the High Court whose appointment itself was arbitrary and was made in disregard of Art.14 of the Constitution as pointed out above\"[Emphasis added\tPrecedent\nIn Parshotam Lal Dhingra 1957 Indlaw SC 103\tPrecedent\nsupra),this Court held that whoever holds civil posts would be entitled to protection of their services in terms of Cl.(2) of Art.309 of the Constitution of India in the event any disciplinary action is taken against them stating: \"The underlying idea obviously is that a provision like this will ensure to them a certain amount of security of tenure\tPrecedent\nCl.(2) protects government servants against being dismissed or removed or reduced in rank without being given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to them\tPrecedent\nIt will be noted that in cl.(1) the words dismissed and removed have been used while in cl.(2\tPrecedent\nthe words dismissed removed and reduced in rank have been used\tPrecedent\nThe two protections are (1) against being dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which the appointment had been made,and (2) against being dismissed,removed or reduced in rank without being heard\tPrecedent\nWhat,then,is the meaning of those expressions dismissed removed or reduced in rank\tPrecedent\nIt has been said in Jayanti Prasad v\tPrecedent\nState of Uttar Pradesh 1951 Indlaw ALL 27 that these are technical words used in cases in which a persons services are terminated by way of punishment\tPrecedent\nThose expressions,it is urged,have been taken from the service rules,where they were used to denote the three major punishments and it is submitted that those expressions should be read and understood in the same sense and treated as words of Art\tPrecedent\nIn Dhirender Singh and Others v\tPrecedent\nState of Haryana and Others [(1997) 2 SCC 712  1996 Indlaw SC 1725],termination of an order of promotion in favour of the appellant was not interfered with by this Court as the same had not been approved by the DIG,being the competent authority\tPrecedent\nIn M.C.Mehta v\tPrecedent\nUnion of India and Others [(1999) 6 SCC 237  1999 Indlaw SC 1396],this Court developed the \"useless formality\" theory stating: \"More recently Lord Bingham has deprecated the useless formality theory in R.v\tPrecedent\nChief Constable of the Thames Valley Police Forces,ex p Cotton by giving six reasons.(See also his article Should Public Law Remedies be Discretionary\tPrecedent\n1991 PL,64\tPrecedent\nA detailed and emphatic criticism of the useless formality theory has been made much earlier in Natural Justice,Substance or Shadow by Prof.D.H.Clark of Canada (1975 PL,27 63) contending that Malloch and Glynn were wrongly decided\tPrecedent\nFoulkes,Craig  and others say that the court cannot prejudge what is to be decided by the decision-making authority.de Smith says courts have not yet committed themselves to any one view though discretion is always with the court\tPrecedent\nWade says that while futile writs may not be issued,a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision\tPrecedent\nThus,in relation to cases other than those relating to admitted or indisputable facts,there is a considerable divergence of opinion whether the applicant can be compelled to prove that the outcome will be in his favour or he has to prove a case of substance or if he can prove a real likelihood of success or if he is entitled to relief even if there is some remote chance of success\tPrecedent\nWe may,however,point out that even in cases where the facts are not all admitted or beyond dispute,there is a considerable unanimity that the courts can,in exercise of their discretion,refuse certiorari,prohibition,mandamus or injunction even though natural justice is not followed\tPrecedent\nWe may also state that there is yet another line of cases as in State Bank of Patiala v\tPrecedent\nS.K.Sharma,Rajendra Singh v\tPrecedent\nState of M.P.1994 Indlaw MP 48 that even in relation to statutory provisions requiring notice,a distinction is to be made between cases where the provision is intended for individual benefit and where a provision is intended to protect public interest\tPrecedent\nIn the former case,it can be waived while in the case of the latter,it cannot be waived\tPrecedent\nIn Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan 2002 Indlaw SC 287 (supra),it was held: \"It is clear that if after the termination of services of the said Dr\tPrecedent\nK.C.Rakesh,the orders of appointment are issued,such orders are not valid\tPrecedent\nIf such appointment orders are a nullity,the question of observance of principles of natural justice would not arise\tPrecedent\nIn Bar Council of India v\tPrecedent\nHigh Court of Kerala [(2004) 6 SCC 311  2004 Indlaw SC 340],it was stated: \"Principles of natural justice,however,cannot be stretched too far\tPrecedent\nTheir application may be subject to the provisions of a statute or statutory rule\tPrecedent\nIn R.S.Garg v\tPrecedent\nState of U.P.and Others [(2006) 6 SCC 430  2006 Indlaw SC 801],it was stated: \"A discretionary power as is well known cannot be exercised in an arbitrary manner\tPrecedent\nIt is necessary to emphasize that the State did not proceed on the basis that the amendment to the Rules was not necessary\tPrecedent\nThe action of a statutory authority,as is well known,must be judged on the basis of the norms set up by it and on the basis of the reasons assigned therefor\tPrecedent\nThe same cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise\tPrecedent\nFor the reasons aforementioned,the impugned judgments cannot be sustained\tRuling by Present Court\nThey are set aside accordingly\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeals are allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nNo costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling

Surja Kunwari, [1921] L. R. 48 I. A. 143, 145, 146 1921 Indlaw PC 56\tPrecedent\nWhat we find here in cl\tRatio of the decision\n3 of the will is an absolute dedication of the premises\tRatio of the decision\nGrey Street to the idol as its permanent habitation with only the right given to the sevayats to reside in the said premises for the purposes of carrying on the daily and periodical seva and the festivals, etc\tRatio of the decision\nof the deity\tRatio of the decision\nThe said premises are expressly declared as dedicated to the deity\tRatio of the decision\nThey are to be registered in the municipal records in the name of the deity, the municipal bills have got to be taken also in his name and none of the testator's representatives, heirs, successors, executors, administrators or assigns is to have any manner of interest in or right to the said premises or is to be competent to give away or effect sale, mortgage, etc\tRatio of the decision\nof the said premises\tRatio of the decision\nThere is thus a clear indication of the intention of the testator to absolutely dedicate the said premises to the deity and it is impossible to urge that there was a partial dedication of the premises to the deity\tRatio of the decision\nThe only thing which was urged by Shri N. C. Chatterjee in support of his contention was that the right to reside in the premises was given to the sevayats and that according to him detracted from the absolute character of the dedication\tArgument\nThis argument however cannot avail the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIt was observed by Lord Buckmaster in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Gnanendra Nath Das v. Surendra Nath Das, (1920) 24 C.W.N. 1926 at p. 1030\tPrecedent\nIn that case it is provided that the shebait for the time being shall be entitled to reside with his family in the said dwelling-house, but the dwelling-house itself is the place specially set apart for the family idols to which specific reference is made in the will, and in their Lordships' opinion the gift is only a perfectly reasonable arrangement to secure that the man in whose hands the supervision of the whole estate is vested should have associated with his duties the right to reside in this named dwelling place\tPrecedent\nThe first contention of the appellants therefore fails and we hold that the dedication of the premises\tRuling by Present Court\n41 Grey, Street to the idol was an absolute dedication\tRuling by Present Court\nregards the second contention, viz., the adverse possession of Nagendra, it is to be noted that under the terms of cl. 3 of the will of Dwarka Nath the representatives, successors and heirs of his two sons Rajendra and Jogendra were successively to perform the seva in the manner therein mentioned and Nagendra was one of the heirs and legal representatives Of Rajendra\tRatio of the decision\nHe was no doubt a minor on the 24th November, 1910, when the terms of settlement were arrived at between the parties to the suit 1909\tRatio of the decision\nHis two elder brothers Jnanendra and Bhupendra were declared to be the then sevayats, but a right was reserved to Nagendra to join with them as a sevayat on, his attaining majority\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as Nagendra is concerned there is a clear finding of fact recorded by Mr. Justice Bose on a specific issue raised in that behalf, viz\tRatio of the decision\nDid Nagendra act as shebait of the plaintiff deity under the wills of Dwarka Nath Ghosh and Rajendra Nath Ghosh\tRatio of the decision\nthat he did act as such shebait and that his possession of the premises\tRatio of the decision\nNo. 41A\tRatio of the decision\nGrey Street was referable to possession on behalf of the idol, 30 .This finding was not challenged in the appeal court and it is too late to challenge the same before us\tRatio of the decision\nIf Nagendra was thus a sevayat of the idol it could not be urged that his possession could in any manner whatever be adverse to the idol and his dealings with the said premises in the manner he purported to do after the 12th October, 1920, could not be evidence of any adverse possession against the idol\tRatio of the decision\nhe position of the sevayat and the effect of his dealings with the property dedicated to the idol has been expounded by Rankin C.J. in Surendrakrishna Ray v. Shree Shree Ishwar Bhubaneshwari Thakuran, (1933\tPrecedent\nCal 54 1932 Indlaw CAL 59\tPrecedent\nBut, in the present case, we have to see whether the possession of two joint shebaits becomes adverse to the idol when they openly claim to divide the property between them\tPrecedent\nThe fact of their possession is in accordance with the idol's title, and the question is whether the change made by them, in the intention with which they hold, evidenced by an application of the rents and profits to their own purposes and other acts, extinguishes the idol's right\tPrecedent\nI am quite unable to hold that it does, because such a change of intention can only be brought home to the idol by means of the shebait's knowledge and the idol can only react to it by the shebait\tPrecedent\nAdverse possession,in such circumstances is a notion almost void of content\tPrecedent\nTrue, any heir or perhaps any descendant of the founder can bring a suit\tPrecedent\nagainst the shebaits on the idol's behalf and, in the present case, it may be said that the acts of the shebaits must have I been notorious in the family\tPrecedent\nBut such persons have no legal duty to protect the endowment and, until the shebait is removed or controlled by the court, he alone can act for the idol\tPrecedent\nWe are in perfect accord with the observations made by Rankin C.J\tRuling by Present Court\nIf a shebait by acting contrary to the terms of his appointment or in breach of his duty as such shebait could claim adverse possession of the dedicated property against the idol it would be putting a premium on dishonesty and breach of duty on his part and no property which is dedicated to an idol would ever be safe\tRuling by Present Court\nThe shebait for the time being is the only person competent to safeguard the interests of the idol, his possession of the dedicated property is the possession of the idol whose sevait he is, and no dealing of his with the property dedicated to the idol could afford the basis of a claim by him for adverse possession of the property against the idol\tRuling by Present Court\nNo shebait can, so long as he continues to be the sevait, ever claim adverse possession against the idol\tRuling by Present Court\nNeither Nagendra nor the appellants who derive their title from the auction sale held on the 9th December, 1936, could therefore claim to have perfected their title to the premises\tRuling by Present Court\nGrey Street by adverse possession\tRuling by Present Court\nThe second contention of the appellants also therefore fails\tRuling by Present Court\nThe further contention urged on behalf of the appellants in regard to the disallowance of the sum of Rs\tRuling by Present Court\n19,000 by the appeal court could not be and was not seriously pressed before us and does not require any consideration\tRuling by Present Court\nhe result therefore is that the appeal fails and must stand dismissed with costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

Ruler of Idar; by another Hajur Order No.807 dated January 12,1934,the respondent was given a further grant in jivarak of 3 villages mentioned in that order with effect from October 1,1933; by yet another Hajur Order No.964 dated November 21,1947,14 villages (including Kapoda and Isarwada) were granted in jivarak to the respondent by the Ruler of Idar in substitution of the villages mentioned in the previous two orders\tFacts\nAccording to the respondent by these grants (parvanas) read together he was given full proprietary rights in the soil of the said villages,that is to say,it was a proprietary Jagir that was granted to him by the then Ruler\tFacts\nAdmittedly,on the coming into force of the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act,1953 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") i.e.with effect from respondent's Daljitgarh Jagir stood abolished and all his rights in the Jagir villages,save as expressly provided by or under the Act,were extinguished and the respondent became entitled to compensation under s.11 of the Act\tFacts\nIt appears that for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act the competent authority (Collector of District Sabarkantha) held an inquiry into the question whether the respondent's Jigir was proprietary (involving any right or interest in the soil) or non-proprietary (involving mere assignment of land revenue or rent due to Government) under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act and having regard to the documentary and other evidence led before it,the competent authority by its order dated September 8,1959,held that the Daljitgarh Jagir of the respondent was a proprietary jagir\tFacts\nIt further appears that pursuant to an order dated November 24,1959,passed by the Mamlatdar,Idar,an entry was made on June 18,1963,in the relevant revenue records (village Form No.6) of one of the villages Kapoda comprised in the Jagir to the effect that the respondent's right to take out gravel and stones was recognised but the right relating to excavation of mica had been reserved and retained by the Government; this entry was only certified on March 30,1965.According to the respondent since the entries made in the revenue records in respect of his rights to mines and mineral products were not sufficient and proper and though the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24,1959 was in respect of two villages,namely,Kapoda and Isarwada,the relevant entry in respect of greval and stones had been made only in regard to village Kapoda,he by his application dated October 11,1968,requested the Collector,Sabarkantha,to issue necessary orders to the Mamlatdar,Idar,to make appropriate entries regarding his rights in the minerals in village Isarwada\tFacts\nA similar application,containing similar request,was also made by the respondent to the Mamlatdar Taluka Idar on October 4,1971.Thereupon a notice under S.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code for the purpose of holding an inquiry into the rights of the respondent to mines and mineral products of the said villages claimed by the respondent wag served upon him but the respondent raised a preliminary objection that such inquiry wag misconceived and incompetent in view of the determination made under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act and having regard to the provisions of S.10 of the Act-his rights,to mines and mineral products were expressly saved; the Collector of Sabarkantha (appellant No.2) overruled the preliminary objection and by order dated February 23,1973,directed that the inquiry shall proceed and the respondent was directed to produce his evidence in support of his claim on a date that would be fixed and intimated to him\tFacts\nAggrieved by this order passed by the Collector on February 23,1973,the respondent preferred a writ petition (Special Civil Application No.1224 of 1973) under Art.227 of the Constitution to the,Gujarat High Court and writ of certiorari quashing the order dated February 23,1973 and a direction restraining the Collector from further proceeding with the inquiry under S.37(2) of the Land Revenue Code were sought\tFacts\nThese reliefs sought by the respondent were resisted by the State of Gujarat and the Collector (the appellants before us) principally on the ground that the inquiry under s.37(2) of the Land Revenue Code into the rights to mines and mineral products in the said villages claimed by the respondent was necessary and proper and could not be said to-be concluded by the determination made under s.2 (4) (1) of the Act by the competent authority\tFacts\nThe High Court negatived the contentions urged by the appellants and took the view that in the determination by the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act that the respondent's Jagir was a proprietary one there was implicit decision that the respondent was a grantee of the soil which included sub-soil entitling him to mines and mineral products and as such a further inquiry by the Collector under S.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code was incompetent and without jurisdiction and,therefore,the Collector's order dated February 23,1973 was liable to be quashed\tRuling by Lower Court\nAccordingly,the High Court set aside the Collector's order and further issued an injunction permanently restraining the State of Gujarat and the Collector from initiating any inquiry under S.37(2) in respect of the respondents rights to mines and mineral products in the said villages\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe appellants seek to challenge the said judgment and order of the Gujarat High Court in this appeal\tFacts\nLearned counsel for the appellants has contended that the High Court has adopted an erroneous view of the scope and ambit of the inquiry contemplated under S.2(4)(i) of the Act by the competent authority in as much as under the said provision the competent authority had power merely to decide the question whether the respondents Jagir was a proprietary or a non-proprietary Jagir and had no Dower or jurisdiction to determine whether on the appointed date that is on August 1,1954 when the Act,came into force the respondent had subsisting rights to mines and minerals products in the Jagir villages so as to be saved under S.10 of the Act\tArgument\nHe urged that it would be for the Collector acting under S.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code to decide the latter question in an inquiry initiated under that provision\tArgument\nAccording to learned counsel the mere circumstance that the respondent's Jagir was found under S.2(4\tArgument\ni) to be proprietary was not tantamount to the establishment by the respondent of his rights to mines and mineral products in the villages of his Jagir for which there must be an actual grant or contract or law or custom or usage recognising such rights and this could only be determined by the Collector by holding an inquiry under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code,and,therefore the High Court was clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that the inquiry initiated by the second appellant under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code,was incompetent or without jurisdiction\tArgument\nOn the other hand,learned counsel for the respondent contended that a determination under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act that a particular Jagir 'was a proprietary one necessarily implied that the grant was of soil and the grantee was entitled to mines and mineral products which were expressly saved under s.10 of the Act and in any event on the facts obtaining in the instant case the competent authority acting under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act,while coming to the conclusion that the respondent's Jagir was proprietary one,bad relied upon the unqualified nature of the grant and also considered the evidence led before it touching upon the several rights such as right to sell fire-wood,babul trees,saltrees,timru trees,right to sell agriculture land and house sites; right to sell stones and gravel,right to sell or allow use of land for manufacture of bricks-enjoyed by the respondent since the time the grant had been made in his favour by the then Ruler and it was on the basis of such evidence that tile competent authority had come to the conclusion that the respondent's Jagir was a proprietary one\tArgument\nHe urged that having regard to such determination that was made by the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act it would be clear that a further inquiry into the respondent's rights to mines and mineral products,particularly gravel and stones under s.37(2) of the Code would be misconceived and incompetent\tArgument\nHe pointed out that presumably pursuant to this determination,the Mamlatdar,Idar,had passed an order on November 24,1959,that the respondent's right to stones and gravel in the two villages of Kapoda and Isarwada,though not to mica,had been recognised by the Government and accordingly the necessary entry pertaining to respondent's right to stones and gravel had been made in the relevant revenue records at least in the case of village Kapoda and had been duly certified\tArgument\nHe further urged that the two letters addressed by the respondent-one to the Collector on October 11,1968 and the other to the Mamlatdar on October 4,1971,merely contained a request to make appropriate entries in the Revenue Records based on the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24,1959 and,therefore,the Collector could not pronounce upon those letters as containing a claim put forward by the respondent for the first time to mines and mineral products in the said Jagir villages to initiate an inquiry under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue de\tArgument\nAccording to the learned counsel for the respondent unless a claim to property or rights over property was Made either by the State against any person or by any person against the State,there could be no occasion for the Collector to held an inquiry contemplated by s.37(2) of the Code\tArgument\nHe,therefore,urged that the High Court was right in quashing the Collector's order dated February 23,1973\tArgument\nHaving regard to the rival contentions of the parties summarised above,it will appear clear that really two questions-one general and the other specific in the light of the facts obtaining in the instant case,arise for our determination in this appeal\tRatio of the decision\nThe general question is whether once the competent authority under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act declares that the particular Jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Land Revenue Code with a view to determining whether the Jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such Jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent\tRatio of the decision\nThe other specific question is whether in the facts of the case and having regard to the nature of evidence considered and the specific finding made by the competent authority while determining the question under s.2(4\tRatio of the decision\ni),the further inquiry initiated by the Collector under s.37(2) was misconceived and uncalled for\tRatio of the decision\nDealing with the first question which is of a general character,it is clear that the answer thereto depends upon the true scope and ambit of the inquiry under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act and to determine the same it will be necessary to consider the scheme and object of the Act and.in particular the purpose of the said inquiry\tRatio of the decision\nThe enactment as its preamble will show,has been put on the Statute Book with a view to abolishing Jagirs of various kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the State of Bombay and to provide for matters consequential and incidental thereto\tRatio of the decision\nS.2 contains the definitions of various expressions some of which are material.s.2(vi) defines the expression \"jagir\" as meaning the grant by or recognition as a grant by,the ruling authority for the time being before the merger of a village,whether such grant is of the soil or an assignment of land revenue or both; there is also an inclusive part of definition with which we are not concerned\tStatute\nS.2(vii) defines \"jagirdar\" as meaning a holder of a jagir village and includes his co-sharer.S.2(xv) defines \"nonproprietary Jagir\" as meaning a jagir which consists of a right in the jagirdar to appropriate as incident of the jagir,land revenue or rent due to Government from persons holding land in a jagir village,but which does not consist of any right or interest in the soil\tStatute\nS.2(xviii) defines \"proprietary jagir\" as meaning a jagir in respect of which the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil\tStatute\nS.2(4),though it forms part of a definition section,contains a substantive provision which is material for our purposes and it runs thus: \"2(4\tStatute\nIf any question arises\tStatute\ni) whether a jagir is proprietary or non-proprietary, (ii)whether any land is Ghatked or Jiwai,or (iii)whetherany person is a permanent holder\tStatute\nthe State Government shall decide the question and such decision shall be final\tStatute\nProvided that the State Government may authorise any officer to decide questions arising under any of the subclauses(i),(ii) and (iii) and subject to 'an appeal to the State Government,his decision shall 'be final\tStatute\nSection 3,which contains the main provision dealing with abolition of jagirs,provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any usage,grant,sanad,order,agreement or any law for the time being in force,on and from the appointed date (which under S.2 (1) (i) is a date on which the Act comes into force,which is August 1,1954),all jagirs shall be deemed to have been abolished and save as expressly provided by or under the provisions of this Act,the right of a jagirdar to recover rent or assessment of land or to levy or recover any kind of tax,cess,fee,charge or any hak and the right of reversion or lapse if any,vested in a jagirdar,and all other rights of a jagirdar or of any person legally subsisting on the said date-,in respect of a jagir village as incidents of jagir shall be deemed to have been extinguished\tStatute\nAs a consequence of the,abolition of jagirs under s.3 all Jagir villages became unalienated villages and,therefore,under s.4 it has been provided that all Jagir villages shall be liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Code and the Rules made thereunder and the provisions of the Code and the Rules relating to unalienated land shall apply to such villages\tStatute\nSs.5 and 6 make provision as to what persons,upon abolition of jagirs and conversion of jagir land into unalienated land would be occupants,who shall be primarily liable to the State Government for payment of land revenue\tStatute\nS.8 declares that all public roads,lands,paths,bridges,titches,dikes,and fences,on or besides the same,the bed of the sea and of harbours,creeks below high water mark,and of rivers,streams,nalaps lakes,wells and tanks,and all canals and water courses etc,situated in jagir village shall vest in the State Government and shall be deemed to be the property of the State Government and all rights held by such jagirdars in such property shall be deemed to have been extinguished.s.10 contains an express saving provision relating to rights to mines and mineral products and it provides that \"nothing in this Act or any other law for the time being in force,shall be deemed to affect the rights of any jagirdar subsisting on the appointed date to mines or mineral products in a jagir village granted or recognised under any contract.,grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage\tStatute\ns.11 (1) provides for the quantum of compensation payable to a non-proprietary jagirdar on account of abolition of his jagir and extinguishment of his rights,while s.11(2) makes similar provision for quantum of compensation to a proprietary jagirdar on account of the abolition of 'his jagir and extinguishment of his rights\tStatute\nSs.13 and 14 provide for methods of awarding compensations to jagirdars by the Collector and against the awards of the Collector under either of these provisions a appeal has been provided at the instance of the aggrieved party to the Revenue Tribunal under s.16.S.17 provides the procedure for disposal of appeals by the Revenue Tribunal while s.18 prescribes a period of limitation for preferring such appeals and s.20 gives finality to the award made by the Collector subject to appeal to the Revenue Tribunal\tStatute\nThe rest of the sections are (if formal character and not material for our purposes\tStatute\nThe aforesaid survey of the material provisions of the Act will bring out two or three aspects very clearly\tRatio of the decision\nIn the first place the,preamble and s.3 of the Act clearly show that the object of the enactment is to abolish Jagirs of all kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the State of Bombay and to convert all Jagir villages into unalienated villages liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly,compensation is made payable under S.11 of the Act to Jagirdars whose Jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a Jagir village,obviously because if by the grant in question the Jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved \"to the Jagirdar under S.10 of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nThirdly,the quantum of compensation payable for abolition of Jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of Jagir has been abolished,whether it is proprietary or non-proprietary; in other words it is clear that the inquiry into the nature of the Jagir under s.2 (4) (i) is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a Jagirdar inasmuch as in the case of.a non-proprietary Jagir the Jagirdar is entitled to compensation at the rate of three times the amount of land revenue received by or due to him as an incident of Jagir during the five years immediately before the appointed date under S.11 (1),while in the case of a proprietary Jagir in respect of land held by a permanent holder the Jagirdar is entitled to compensation equivalent to three multiples of the assessment fixed for such land; S.11(3) provides for compensation and computation thereof to a Jagirdar having any right or interest in any property referred to in S.8.In such an inquiry ordinarily no determination of any rights of the Jagirdar to mines or mineral products in a Jagir village will be undertaken for' no compensation is payable in respect of any rights to mines and mineral products in a Jagir village\tRatio of the decision\nThere is yet one more aspect emerging from the definition of the expression \"proprietary jagir\" which leads to the same inference.\"Proprietary jagir\" has been defined in S.2(xviii) to mean a jagir in respect of which the Jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,the competent authority holding an inquiry under s.2(4) (i) can come to the conclusion that a particular Jagir is proprietary if it finds that the Jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement is entitled to some rights or interest in the soil other than mines or mineral products\tRatio of the decision\nThese aspects bring out true scope and ambit of the inquiry under sec.2(4)(i) and clearly show that the determination of the question whether a Jagir is proprietary or nonproprietary does not necessarily involve the determination of the question whether the Jagirdar had any rights to mines and mineral products on the appointed date.it is true that prima facie the owner of the surface of the land would be entitled to everything beneath the land and ordinarily mines and mineral products would pass with the right to the surface but this would be so in the absence of any reservations made in the grant; if there be reservations or qualifications in regard to mines or mineral products,in the grant,then these would not pass\tRatio of the decision\nIn this case also notwithstanding the alleged unqualified grant in favour of the respondent the Mamladar's order dated November 24,1959,on which the respondent strongly relies,has held that the rights to excavate mica were retained by the State and not granted to the respondent,though the material or basis on which it is so held is not available on the record\tRatio of the decision\nIt is,therefore,not possible to accept the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that a determination under s.2 (4) (i) of the Act to the effect that a particular Jagir is a proprietary one necessarily implies that the grantee is entitled to mines and mineral products in the villages comprised in the grant,especially ,when having regard to the definition given in s.2(xviii) a Jagir could be proprietary without a right to mines and mineral products\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,our answer to the general question raised above would be that even after the competent authority has declared a particular Jagir to be a proprietary one under s.2(4\tRatio of the decision\ni) of the Act,a further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code into the question whether a Jagirdar had any subsisting rights to mines and mineral products in the Jagir villages on the appointed date would be competent unless the grant of a right to mines and mineral products ,or the actual enjoyment thereof in keeping with the grant happens to ,be the basis of the,determination under s.2 (4) (1 ) of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nTurning to the other specific question raised by counsel for the respondent before us we are clearly of the view that in the facts and circumstances of the case the inquiry initiated by the Collector under s.37(4) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code will have to be regarded as incompetent,misconceived and uncalled for\tRatio of the decision\nThe main valid objection to the said inquiry is that the condition precedent the existence of which canlead to the initiation of such inquiry is absent here\tRatio of the decision\nS.37(1) of the Code contains the well-known declaratory provision where under all public roads,lanes and paths,the bridges,ditches,dikes,beds of the sea,harbours and creeks below high-water-mark,and of rivers,streams,nallas,lakes and tanks etc.and all lands wherever situated,which are not the property of individuals,are declared to be,with all rights in or over the same,or appertaining thereto,the property of the Crown; then follows sub-s.(2) which is material and it runs thus: \"37(2\tStatute\nWhere any property or any right in or over any property is claimed by or on behalf of the Crown or by any person as against the Crown,it shall be lawful for the Collector or a survey officer,after formal inquiry of which due notice has been given,to pass an order deciding the claim\tStatute\nUnder sub-s.(3),the decision of the Collector under sub-s.(2) is rendered final subject to the result of a suit that is required to be instituted in a Civil Court within one year of the said\tStatute\ndecision.on a reading of sub-s.(2),which we have quoted above,it will appear clear that laying a claim to a property or any right in or over the property either by the State against an individual or by the individual ,against the State is a condition precedent to the Collector's power to hold an inquiry contemplated by that provision\tStatute\nIn other words,before the Collector can initiate an inquiry under that provision,either the State or the individual must put forward a claim to a property or any right in or over the property and it is such claim that is to be inquired into by the Collector whose decision,subject to a civil suit filed within one year,is rendered final\tRatio of the decision\nThe question in the instant case is whether the respondent by making the two applications,one dated October 11,1968 to the Collector of Sabarkantha and the other dated October 4,1971,to the Mamlatdar,Taluka Idar,could be said to have put forward or laid a claim to a right to excavate gravel and stone a particular mineral product-so as to afford an occasion for the Collector to initiate the inquiry\tRatio of the decision\nThe material on record clearly shows that the respondent could not be said to have done so\tRatio of the decision\nAdmittedly,by his previous order dated November 24,1959,the Mamlatdar of Talukadar,had declared that the respondent had been granted all the rights,particularly the right to quarry and remove gravel and Stones,in Isarwada and Kapoda villages in the year 1947 by the Idar Stale and that thereafter in the years 1952 and 1953 the Jagirdar had taken the produce of stone and that,therefore,the Government could not stop him from \"taking out gravel and stones\" but that the rights to excavating mica had been retained by the State; further,pursuant to this 'order the appropriate entry had been made in the relevant village records (Form No.6) of village Kapoda on June 18,1963,recognising the respondents right to,take out gravel and stones,which entry was verified and confirmed on March 30,1965,it was in this situation that the respondent made the aforesaid two applications,one to the Collector,Sabarkantha and the other to the Mamladar Taluka Idar,whereby relying upon the previous order of the Mamlatdar dated November 24,1959,he requested that appropriate entries pertaining to his right to gravel and stones should be similarly made in respect of village Isarwada\tFacts\nIt is thus clear that by these two applications the respondent had not put forward any claim as such to excavating gravel and stones for the first time' but,had merely requested the making of appropriate entry with regard to his said right which had already been recognised by the State Government previously\tRatio of the decision\nThat being the position,there was no occasion for the Collector to initiate the inquiry under s.37(2) of the Code-in fact,he had no jurisdiction to do so,the condition precedent not being satisfied\tRatio of the decision\nMoreover,having regard to the statement made by counsel for the respondent before us it would be unfair to subject the respondent to the further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nWe may state that Counsel for-the respondent categorically stated before the Court that his client was confining his right to excavating only one type of mineral product,namely,gravel and stones,and that too from only two villages,namely,Kapoda and Isarwada comprised in his Jagir,in regard to which the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24,1959,was quite clear and,therefore,he urged that the further inquiry under s.37(2) of the Code into that very right was misconceived and uncalled for\tArgument\nWe find considerable force in this contention\tRatio of the decision\nBesides,while determining the proprietary nature of the grant under s.2(4)(1) of the Act the competent authority had,on evidence led before it,alluded among others to the respondent's right to excavate and sell gravel and stones and enjoyment thereof by the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nIn these circumstances it would be fair and proper that the respondent is not subjected to a further inquiry under.s.37(2) of the Code so far as his right to excavating gravel and stones from the two villages of Kapoda and Isarwada is concerned\tRatio of the decision\nIf and when he prefers a claim to this particular mineral productfrom other villages comprised in his grant or to the other mines ormineral products in all the villages including Isarwada and Kapodaan inquiry into such claim under s.37(2) could be held,but even the decision at such inquiry would be subject to adjudication by a Civil Court in appropriate proceedings,for the final pronouncement on such rights must,as is clear from the scheme ,of the Bombay Land Revenue Code,always rest with the Civil Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn this view of the matter,we feel that the High Court was right in its final conclusion whereby it has quashed the inquiry initiated by the Collecor under s.37(2) of the Code and issued the necessary injunction prayed for by the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal is,therefore,dismissed with costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties,the Appellant requested the Bench not to enter into the merits on this question in this LPA since the parties may prosecute their remedies in the Civil Court for such adjudication,and therefore,that aspect was not considered by the High Court\tFacts\nHowever,in the facts of the conflicting claims,the Appellant made grievance to the Deputy Collector and the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties in respect of the Mutation made in favour of the Respondent Gulabai and other Respondents and,therefore,by order dated 18.9.1984 the Deputy Collector and Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties,Pune,directed the Sub-Divisional Officer,Haveli Sub Division to take up the case in revision under Section 257 of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and pass necessary orders\tFacts\nIn view of these directions,the Sub-Divisional Officer,Haveli,Sub Division,Pune,initiated proceeding RTS Revision 14 of 1984 and by order dated 30.7.1985 cancelled the mutation Entry No.1836 which comprises land admeasuring 7897 sq.yards and directed necessary corrections in the record as per the observations made in the order\tFacts\nIt appears that the said order was taken in appeal by the respondent and the matter was remanded to the Sub Divisional Officer\tFacts\nAfter remand,the Sub Divisional Officer,conducted inquiry and again passed an order on 29.10.1987 and confirmed the earlier order\tFacts\nTherefore,the RTS Appeal No.128 of 1987 was preferred before the Collector,which was disposed off by the Additional Collector on 13.7.1993.By the said order,the Order of the third Sub-Divisional Officer was maintained\tFacts\nHowever,further inquiry as directed by the SDO was to be conducted\tFacts\nSince the mutation Entry No.1836 was cancelled by above order,the Talathi gave effect to these orders and effected the mutation Entry No.2176 and showed the disputed properties in the name of the Collector and Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties\tFacts\nThe directions were issued by the Collector to the Tahsildar to place the appellant in possession of the property as per the orders of the Deputy Collector and the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties\tFacts\nHowever,instead of giving effect to those orders,it appears that the Revenue Officers at Tahsil level effected two mutations,viz,Mutation No.2377 and 2394.By mutation entry No.2377 the name of respondent was again mutated in the record and by the mutation Entry No.2394 the name of Genu Kadu was mutated in the record\tFacts\nSince the Collector noticed on complaint that the orders of the Collector has been bypassed or surpassed by the Subordinate Revenue Officers,the Collector by order dated 12.7.1999 directed the SDO to take these mutations namely mutation Entry No.2377 and 2394 in revision and therefore the Sub-Divisional Officer,Maval Division has taken these mutations in revision bearing RTS Revision No.12 of 1999.The said revision was decided by the Sub Divisional officer at Maval on 28.1.2000 and those mutations were cancelled\tFacts\nBeing aggrieved by the order passed in the said revision,Respondent No.2 Lalwani preferred RTS Appeal No.81 of 2000 and the Respondent No.3 Genu Kadu preferred RTS Appeal No.114 of 2000.Both\tFacts\nthese RTS Appeals were heard by the Additional Collector,Pune and by order dated 28.5.2001 the Addl\tFacts\nCollector,Pune dismissed the said appeals and confirmed the order of the Sub Divisional Officer,Maval\tFacts\nAggrieved by the said order of the Additional Collector,Respondent No.2 preferred RTS Revision No.330 of 2001 under Section 257 of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code,1966 before the Additional Commissioner,Pune Division,Pune\tFacts\nThe said revision was decided by the Additional Commissioner,Pune by order dated 22.11.2001 and the said revision was dismissed\tFacts\nRespondent No.2 challenged this order of the Additional Commissioner by filing the proceeding RTS 3402/Pra.kra.309/L-6 by way of second revision before the Revenue Minister for State and the said proceeding was decided by the Minister for State on 18.10.2002.The Revenue Minister allowed the said proceeding and set aside the orders passed by the Sub Divisional Officer,Maval dated 28.1.2000,order dated 28.5.2001 of Additional Collector,Pune and of Additional Commissioner dated 22.11.2001,and thus,restored the position as reflected by the Mutation Entries Nos.1836 and 2377 and 2394.Thus,all the entries in favour of the Respondents were protected and maintained by the order of the State Minister for Revenue\tFacts\nAppellant challenged the order dated 19.10.2002 passed by the Minister by filing a writ petition,which was dismissed by learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court\tFacts\nThereafter,the appellant filed Letters Patent Appeal,which was also dismissed by the Division Bench holding that when the State Minister for Revenue entertained the matter,he was possessed of jurisdiction under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and,therefore,the order passed by him under the said authority is within his jurisdiction,power and competence\tFacts\nThe Division Bench observed thus\tRuling by Lower Court\nWe record our finding\tRuling by Lower Court\nthat under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code more than one revision is possible\tRuling by Lower Court\nNow coming to the facts of the present case,the mutation Entry No.1836 was in fact certified\tRuling by Lower Court\nHowever,the Sub-Divisional Officer has taken the said mutation in revision in RTS Revision No.14 of 1984 and has set aside the mutation by order dated 30.7.1985.There was appeal as against that order which was remanded\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt was again decided by the Sub Divisional Officer on 29.10.1987 and the said mutation was set aside\tRuling by Lower Court\nThere was RTS Appeal No.128 of 1987 which was decided on 13.7.1993.In view of these orders the mutation entry No.1836 was cancelled and Mutation Entry No.2176 was effected whereby the name of the Collector and the Deputy Collector of the Evacuee Property was entered into 7 X 12 extracts\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt is further found that when the orders of the Collector directing to put the petitioner into possession were not obeyed by the subordinate Revenue Officers and the Revenue Officers effected the mutation entry No.2377 in favour of the Respondent Nos.3 Gulabai Desai and Mutation Entry No.2394 in favour of the Respondent No.5 Genu Kadu and thereafter for second time the special Divisional Officer,Maval,has exercised the revisional powers under Section 257 and initiated proceeding RTS Revision 12 of 1999 in respect of the mutation entry No.2377 and 2394.The RTS Revision 12/99 was allowed on 28.1.2000 as against that two RTS appeals namely,RTS Appeal No.81 of 2000 and RTS Appeal No.114 of 2000 were preferred by the Respondent\tRuling by Lower Court\nThey were decided on 28.5.2001.As against that the RTS Revision No.330 of 2001 was preferred\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe same was dismissed\tRuling by Lower Court\nAs against that the RTS proceeding bearing No.3402 /Pra\tRuling by Lower Court\nKra.309/L-6 was preferred before the Minister for State\tRuling by Lower Court\nAll these proceedings will show that twice the Sub-Divisional Officer has exercised the revisional power under Section 257 at the directions of the Collector,namely the RTS Revision No.14 of 1984 and RTS Revision No.12 of 1999.It will further reveal that the appeals as against the RTS Revision No.14 of 1984 was preferred by the parties in view of the provisions of Section 247 and 249 sub-section 2.It will equally appear that when the orders were passed in Revision Application No.12 of 1999 before the Sub Divisional Officer in exercise of the powers under Section 257 the parties have preferred two RTS appeals in view of the provisions of Section 247 and 249 sub-section 2.Not only that,thereafter the RTS Revision Application No.330 of 2001 was also preferred before the Commissioner and if the view is taken that the second revision is not tenable then in that circumstances since the first order passed in RTS Revision No.12 of 1999 is a revisional order,this second revision before the Commissioner being RTS Revision No.330 of 2001 would not have been tenable\tRuling by Lower Court\nHowever,said revision RTS 330 of 2001 is tenable since the appeals as provided under Section 247 and 249 intervene in between the revisional orders passed by the Sub-Divisional officer and the Commissioner\tRuling by Lower Court\nThus,in short,we find that the scheme under Maharashtra Land Revenue Code is quite different scheme and it permits more than one revision\tRuling by Lower Court\nThus,viewed from any angle,we find that the State Minister for Revenue when he entertained the matter,State Minister for revenue was possessed of jurisdiction under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and therefore the order passed by him under the said authority is within his jurisdiction,power and competence\tRuling by Lower Court\nHence,the present appeal by special leave\tFacts\nMr\tArgument\nHuzefa Ahmadi,learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant,mainly attacked the revisional power exercised by the Minister concerned in purported exercise of jurisdiction under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code\tArgument\nIn the alternative,learned Senior counsel submitted that even if it were to be admitted without prejudice that second revision is maintainable,the Minister being the revisional authority should not have interfered with the findings recorded by all the six Revenue Authorities\tArgument\nReferring the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Sambappa vs\tArgument\nState of Maharashtra [(2002) SCC on line,Bombay 1222],learned counsel submitted that when the Sub-Divisional Officer,Additional Collector and Additional Commissioner had concurrently recorded finding in favour of the appellant by observing that the revenue record is not in consonance with the factual aspect and they have directed to correct the revenue entries,in such a case,the second revisional authority exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the said application and interfering with the finding of fact\tArgument\nSection 257 makes it clear that a revisional authority has to consider only the legality and propriety of the decision\tArgument\nLearned counsel referring the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure tried to impress us that when the power of revision is given to the District Judge,then the High Court cannot entertain second revision petition under Section 115 of the Code\tArgument\nLearned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of State of Kerala vs\tArgument\nK.M.Charia Abdulla & Co.,AIR 1965\tArgument\nSC 1585 1964 Indlaw SC 353 and Hari Shankar vs\tArgument\nRao Girdhari Lal Chowdhury,AIR 1963 SC 698 1961 Indlaw SC 157\tArgument\nAhmadi,learned senior counsel further submitted that a request was made to the High Court not to enter into the merit of the case,and to confine itself to the question whether a second revision was at all maintainable,in the light of the ratio in Harishankar's case 1961\tArgument\nIndlaw SC 157 (supra),(1962) Suppl.(1) SCR 933\tArgument\n1961 Indlaw SC 157,Hiralal Kapur vs\tArgument\nPrabhu Choudhury,(1988) 2 SCC 172 1988 Indlaw SC 342 and Helper Girdharbhai vs\tArgument\nSaiyed Mohmad Mirasaheb Kadri and others,(1987) 3 SCC 538 1987 Indlaw SC 28281.Learned counsel also drew our attention to the decision of this Court in Dharampal vs\tArgument\nRamshri,(1993) 1 SCC 435 1993 Indlaw SC 1325 where this Court held\tArgument\nthat a second revision to the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr\tArgument\nP.C.was not permitted\tArgument\nLastly,Mr\tArgument\nAhmadi submitted that the second revision would not lie under Section 257 of the Revenue Code since Section 259 of the Code provides an opportunity to the State Government to only correct any \"Final Order\" while exercising power under the provisions of Section 257 i.e.with regard to its legality and propriety\tArgument\nRavindra Srivastava,learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent-State,at the very outset submitted that the appellant conceded before the High Court not to decide the merit of the case\tArgument\nThe only point raised before the High Court was with regard to the maintainability of second revision before the State Government under Section 257 of the Revenue Code\tArgument\nLearned counsel submitted that Section 257 expressly confers power of revision on the State Government which power is coupled with power of control and superintendence\tArgument\nLearned counsel submitted that the Commissioner or the Additional Commissioner is not equal in a rank but subordinate to the State Government\tArgument\nLearned counsel submitted that the State Government is the supreme revenue authority and existence of more than one appeal or revision to an aggrieved party is not per se abhorrent to any legal principle; depends upon the Statute\tArgument\nSrivastava then contended that the High Court correctly analysed and appreciated the scheme of the Code vis a vis judicial review in revenue matters\tArgument\nLearned counsel put heavy reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of Ishwar Singh vs\tArgument\nState of Rajasthan and others,(2005\tPrecedent\n2 SCC 334 2005 Indlaw SC 6 for the proposition that there can be a second revision under the same provision of the Statute\tArgument\nThe only question that falls for consideration is as to whether a second revision under Section 257 is maintainable and that whether the State Government exceeds its jurisdiction in entertaining the second revision\tRatio of the decision\nBefore we proceed to decide the aforesaid question,we would like to refer the relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1966\tStatute\nSection 2(31) defines the Revenue Officer as under:- \"2 (31)\" revenue officer\" means every officer of any rank whatsoever appointed under any of the provisions of this Code,and employed in or about the business of the land revenue or of the surveys,assessment,accounts,or records connected therewith\tStatute\nChapter II deals with the Revenue Officers,their powers and duties\tStatute\nSections 5,6 and 7 reads as under:- \"5.Chief Controlling authority in revenue matters\tStatute\nThe chief controlling authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his division shall vest in the Commissioner,subject to the superintendence,direction and control of the State Government\tStatute\n6.Revenue Officers in division\tStatute\nThe State Government shall appoint a Commissioner of each division; and may appoint in a division an Additional Commissioner and so many Assistant Commissioners as may be expedient,to assist the Commissioner: Provided that,nothing in this section shall preclude the appointment of the same officer as Commissioner for two or more divisions\tStatute\n7.Revenue officers in district.(1)The State Government shall appoint a Collector for each district (including the City of Bombay who shall be in charge of the revenue administration there of; and a Tahsildar for each taluka who shall be the chief officer entrusted with the local revenue administration of a taluka\tStatute\nThe State Government may appoint one or more Additional Collectors and in each district (including the City of Bombay and so many Assistant Collectors and Deputy Collectors (with such designations such as \"First\",\"Second\",Super numerary\",etc\tStatute\nAssistants as may be expressed in the order of their appointment),one or more Naib-Tahsildars in a taluka,and one or more Additional Tahsidars or Naib-Tahsildars therein and such other persons (having such designations) to assist the revenue officers as it may deem expedient\tStatute\n3) Subject to the general orders of the State Government,the Collector may place any Assistant or Deputy Collector in charge of one more sub-divisions of a district,or may himself retain charge thereof\tStatute\nSuch Assistant or Deputy Collector may also be called a Sub-Divisional Officer\tStatute\nThe Collector may appoint to each district as many persons as he thinks fit to be Circle Officers and Circle Inspectors to be in charge of a Circle,and one or more Talathis for a saza,and one or more Kotwals or other village servants for each village or group of villages,as he may deem fit\tStatute\nSection 11 of the Code is worth to be quoted herein\tStatute\nbelow:- \"11.Subordination of officers\tStatute\n1) All revenue officers shall be subordinate to the State Government\tStatute\n2) Unless the State Government directs otherwise,all revenue officers in a division shall be subordinate to the Commissioner,and all revenue Officers 2[in a district (including the City of Bombay)] shall be subordinate to the Collector\tStatute\n3)Unless the State Government directs otherwise,all other Revenue Officers Including survey officers shall be subordinated,the one to the other,in such order as the State Government may direct\tStatute\nSections 13 and 14 deal with the powers and duties of all Revenue Officers\tStatute\nFrom reading of the aforesaid provisions,it is manifest that the State Government makes appointment of the Revenue Officers including the Commissioner and the Chief Controlling Authorities in the revenue matters\tRatio of the decision\nSection 5 makes it clear that the Chief Controlling Authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his Division shall vest with the Commissioner,subject to superintendence,directions and control of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nSection 11 provides that all Revenue Officers shall be subordinate to the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nIt is,therefore,clear that in revenue matters the State Government is the Supreme Revenue Authority\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,we noticed the scheme of the Code in the matters of hearing and disposal of appeals,revision and review\tRatio of the decision\nSection 247 deals with the appeal and appellate authorities,which reads as under:- \"247.Appeal and appellate authorities\tStatute\nIn the absence of any express provisions of this Code,or of any law for the time being in force to the contrary,an appeal shall lie from any decision or order passed by a revenue or survey officer specified in column 1 of the Schedule E under this Code or any other law for the time being in force to the officer specified in column 2 of that Schedule whether or not such decision or order may itself have been passed on appeal from the decision of order of the officer specified in column 1 of the said Schedule\tStatute\nProvided that,in no case the number of appeals shall exceed two\tStatute\n2) When on account of promotion of change of designation,an appeal against any decision or order lies under this section to the same officer who has passed the decision or order appealed against,the appeal shall lie to such other officer competent to decide the appeal to whom it may be transferred under the provisions of this Code\tStatute\nSection 248 is also relevant which provides the forum of appeal to the State Government\tStatute\nSimilarly,Section 249 makes provision of appeal against the review or revision\tStatute\nThe schedule preferred to in Section 227 mentions the Authorities before whom appeal would lie\tStatute\nThe Schedule appended to the Code is as follows:- Schedule E (See section 247\tStatute\nSection 257 is the relevant provision which deals with the power of State Government and of certain revenue and survey officers to call for and examine the records and proceedings of Subordinate Officers\tStatute\nSection 257 reads as under:- \"257.Power of State Government and of certain revenue and survey officers to call for and examine records and proceedings of subordinate officers\tStatute\nThe State Government and any revenue of survey officer,not inferior in rank to an Assistant or Deputy Collector or a Superintendent of Land Records,in their respective departments,may call for and examine the record of any inquiry or the proceedings of any subordinate revenue or survey officer,for the purpose of satisfying itself or himself,as the case may be,as to the legality or propriety of any decision or order passed,and as to the regularity of the proceedings of such officer\tStatute\nA Tahsildar,a Naib-Tahsildar,and a District Inspector of Land Records\tStatute\nmay in the same manner call for and examine the proceedings of any officer subordinate to them in any matter in which neither a formal nor a summary inquiry has been held\tStatute\n3) If in any case,it shall appear to the State Government,or any officer referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) that any decision or order or proceedings so called for should be modified,annulled or reversed,it or he may pass such order thereon as it or he deems fit\tStatute\nProvided that,the State Government or such officer shall not vary or reverse any order affecting any question of right between private persons without having to the parties interested notice to appear and to be heard in support of such order\tStatute\nProvided further that,an Assistant of Deputy Collector shall not himself pass such order in any matter in which a formal inquiry has been held,but shall submit the record with his opinion to the Collector,who shall pall such order thereon as he may deem fit\tStatute\nA bare reading of the aforesaid provision would show that the provision uses the word 'and' for State Government but for other Revenue officers\tRatio of the decision\nit uses the word 'or'.The language and the words used in the said provision suggest that jurisdiction of the State Government is concurrent with the jurisdiction of other Revenue officers in deciding the revision\tRatio of the decision\nHence,even if one party goes to the Commissioner in revision,the State Government can still be approached under Section 257 for revision\tRatio of the decision\nThe power of revision exercised by any Revenue officer including the Commissioner is a proceeding by a subordinate officer and the State Government can satisfy itself as to the legality and propriety of any decision including the order passed in revision by the Revenue officers\tRatio of the decision\nFurther,in view of the fact that State Government itself appoints the Revenue officers including the Commissioner under the scheme of the Code and all Revenue officers are subordinate to the State Government as per Section 11 of the Act,and even the Chief Controlling Authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his Division is vested with the Commissioner,they are subject to the superintendence,direction and control of the State Government as provided under Section 5 of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nThe power of the State Government has further been widened by Section 259 of the Code,which reads as under:- \"259.Rules as to decisions or orders expressly made final Whenever in this Code,it is provided that a decision or order shall be final or conclusive,such provision shall mean that no appeal lies from any such decision or order; but it shall be lawful to the State Government alone to modify,annul or reverse any such decision or order under the provision of Section 257\tStatute\nThe aforesaid provision makes it clear that even if the decision is considered to be final,the State Government's power to call for and examine the record and proceedings of subordinate officers is saved\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,the State Government in exercise of its revisional as well as general power of superintendence and control can call for any record of proceedings and consider the legality and propriety of the orders passed by the Revenue officers under Section 247 or 257 of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nFrom perusal of the entire scheme of the Code including Section 257,it is manifest that the revisional powers are not only exercisable by the State Government but also by certain other Revenue officers\tRatio of the decision\nThere is nothing in the Code to suggest that if these revisional powers are exercised by a Revenue officer who has jurisdiction,it cannot be further exercised by a superior Revenue officer or by the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nA fair reading of Sections 257 and 259 suggests that if revisional powers are exercised by a Revenue officer having jurisdiction to do so,further revisional power can be exercised by the superior officer or by the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nA similar question came for consideration before this Court in the case of Ishwar Singh vs\tPrecedent\n2 SCC 334 under the Rajasthan Cooperative Societies Act,1965.In that Ac,t by Section 128 power was conferred upon the State Government and the Registrar to call for and examine the records of any enquiry or proceedings of any other matter,of any officer subordinate to them,for the purpose of satisfying themselves as to the legality or propriety of any decision or order passed by such officer\tPrecedent\nIt was submitted by the counsel that Section 128 related to two authorities i.e.the State Government and the Registrar\tPrecedent\nIn fact the two authorities are interchangeable\tPrecedent\nIf one authority exercises revisional power,the other authority logically cannot have exercised such power\tPrecedent\nHence,it was argued that second revision was not maintainable\tPrecedent\nRejecting the submission this Court held:- \"20.Sub-section (2) of Section 124 provides that if the decision or order is made by the Registrar,appeal lies to the Government and if the decision or order is made by any other person,or a cooperative society,the appeal lies to the Registrar\tPrecedent\nTherefore,under Chapter XIII a clear distinction is made between the State Government and the Registrar\tPrecedent\nThe test is whether the two authorities with concurrent revisional jurisdiction are equal in rank\tPrecedent\nIt is,therefore,not correct as contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the two authorities i.e.the State Government and the Registrar are interchangeable\tPrecedent\nThe power of the Government and the Registrar in terms of Section 128 excludes matters which are covered by Section 125 i.e.revision by the Tribunal\tPrecedent\nConsidering the entire scheme of the Code,and the provisions contained in Sections 257 and 259,we are of the definite opinion that the Minister concerned of the State Government can entertain second revision to satisfy the legality and propriety of the order passed by the Revenue Officer\tRuling by Present Court\nThe Division Bench of the Bombay High Court has elaborately discussed the question and passed the impugned order holding that Section 257 confers jurisdiction to the State Government to entertain its revision against the order passed by any Revenue Officer either in appeal or in revision\tRuling by Present Court\nWe find no infirmity in the impugned order passed by the High Court\tRuling by Present Court\nHence,this appeal has no merit which is accordingly dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nBefore parting with the order,we must make it clear that in view of the request made by the appellant before the High Court not to enter into the merit of the case since the party may prosecute their remedies in the Civil Court for adjudication,we have not expressed any opinion with regard to the merit of the case of the parties\tRuling by Present Court\nThe parties may prosecute their remedies in Civil Court in accordance with law\tRuling by Present Court\nPetition dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

literary,dramatic or musical work by an amateur club or society,if the performance is given to a non-paying audience,or for the benefit of a religious institution\tStatute\nBefore adverting to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties,we may notice the issues framed in the suit,which are: \"(i) Does plaintiff prove that late Dr\tRatio of the decision\nShivaramaji Karanth had acquired copyright in respect of seven Yakshagana Prasangas and also in respect of Yakshagana dramatic or theatrical form i.e.,Bhishma\tRatio of the decision\nVijaya,Nala Damayanthi,Kanakaangti or Kanakangi Kalyana,Abhimanyu or Abhimanyu Vadha,Chitrangadha or Babruvahana Kalaga,Panchavati Chritha followed in the plaint\tRatio of the decision\nHas the plaintiff became entitled to the said right under the Registered Will dated 18.06.1994\tRatio of the decision\nDoes the plaintiff prove that her right under the said Will was infringed by the defendants\tRatio of the decision\nIndisputably,in view of the submissions made at the bar,respondent had acquired copyright in respect of seven Yakshagana Prasangas as also in respect of Yakshagana dramatic or theatrical form as a residuary legatee in terms of clause 12 of the Will dated 18.6.1994\tRuling by Lower Court\nHowever,we may notice that whereas the trial court has proceeded on the basis that clause 12 of the Will shall apply in the instant case,the High Court opined that clause 11 thereof is attracted,stating: \"No doubt,by reading para-12 of the 'Will' in isolation,one can certainly arrive at the conclusion that the bequest made in favour of the plaintiff is in the nature of residuary bequest\tRuling by Lower Court\nBut,that is not all,in the 'Will'-Ex\tRuling by Lower Court\nP-1.I have already referred to para No.11 of the 'Will' while dealing with the topic dramatic works vis-'-vis literary work and therefore if the 'Will' is read in its entirety and if we take into account,the benefits that flow from the bequest made by Dr\tRuling by Lower Court\nKaranth in favour of the plaintiff,it is not as if the plaintiff received the bequest only in respect of the things which form the residuary as mentioned in para-12 of the 'Will' but the plaintiff also was given the copyrights in respect of literary works and all books as well as the right to print,republished and mark the literary works as well as the books\tRuling by Lower Court\nReferring to the new Encyclopaedia Britannica and Halsbury's Laws of England,that a literary work with dramatic elements in it would also be literary work,the High Court observed: \"Dramatic works also could contain in its,passages of great literary taste,as in the case of great plays of William Shakespear\tRuling by Lower Court\nTherefore,the main classification as literary work and dramatic work cannot be construed to mean that dramatic work has nothing to do with literary work\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe only difference I see in them is that the dramatic work (Plays) forms the text upon which the performance of the plays rests whereas a 'literary work' enables one to read the printed words\tRuling by Lower Court\nNeither of the two can be produced without the imaginative skill of the author\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt was furthermore held: \"I am of the considered opinion that all the above changes brought about by Dr\tRuling by Lower Court\nKaranth in respect of Yakshagana Ballet leads to the inference that the imaginative faculties of Dr\tRuling by Lower Court\nKaranth permeated the entire Yakshagana Prasangas and thus a new look was given to the Yakshagana Ballets\tRuling by Lower Court\nI,therefore,hold that the bequest of copyright in literary works and books in favour of the plaintiff by Dr\tRuling by Lower Court\nKaranth,will have to be treated as the bequest covering the dramatic works also since I have also drawn the conclusion that the dramatic works is also a form of literature\tRuling by Lower Court\nTherefore,necessity of mentioning copyright separately in respect of dramatic works does not arise\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe plaintiff,therefore,is entitled to copyright even in respect of the dramatic works namely the seven prasangas,by virtue of bequest made in her favour in respect of copyrights and books\tRuling by Lower Court\nBroadly speaking,a dramatic work may also come within the purview of literary work being a part of dramatic literature\tRatio of the decision\nThe new Encyclopaedia Britannica (Vol-IV) 15th Edition,provides the following information about \"Dramatic Literature\tRatio of the decision\nDramatic Literature: the texts of plays that can be read,as distinct from being seen and heard in performance\tRatio of the decision\nWe must,however,notice that the provisions the Act make a distinction between the 'literary work' and 'dramatic work'.Keeping in view the statutory provisions,there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that copyright in respect of performance of 'dance' would not come within the purview of the literary work but would come within the purview of the definition of 'dramatic work'.We,however,do not mean to suggest that any act of literary work will be outside the purview of the Will dated 18.6.1994.Our exercise in this behalf was only for the purpose of clarifying the provisions of the Act with reference to the findings arrived at by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nFor the aforementioned reasons,we agree with Dr\tRatio of the decision\nDhavan that paragraph 12 of the Will,namely,residuary clause shall apply in the instant case apart from the areas which are otherwise covered by paragraph 11 of the Will\tRatio of the decision\nThe residuary clause will apply because it is well settled that no part of the stay lies in limbo\tRatio of the decision\nIt was also not a case where respondent in any manner whatsoever waived her right\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned trial judge on issue No.4 opined that plaintiff had not been able to prove actual loss or damage particularly having regard to the fact that Dr\tFacts\nKaranth had associated himself with the appellants for a long time\tFacts\nThe learned trial judge recognized the equitable interest vested in the plaintiff -respondent\tFacts\nA declaratory decree,therefore,was passed\tFacts\nWe may notice at this stage that the form of injunction granted both by the learned trial judge as also by the High Court in favour of the plaintiff-respondent\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe operative part of the judgment of the trial court reads as under: \"Defendants or their employees or agents are restrained from performing the above said 7 ballets or Prasangas or in parts thereof in any manner as evolved distinctively by Dr\tRuling by Lower Court\nKaranth by way of permanent injunction\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe High Court,however,directed: \"(iii\tRuling by Lower Court\nAs far as the restraint order passed by the Trial Court by granting permanent injunction to the plaintiff is concerned,the same is modified by ordering that if the appellants desire to stage any of the seven Yakshagana prasangas in the manner and form as conceived in all respects viz.,costumes,choreography and direction by Dr\tRuling by Lower Court\nKaranth,the appellants can do so only in accordance with the provisions of the Copyrights Act,1957 in view of copyright in seven prasangas vesting with the plaintiff\tRuling by Lower Court\nDecree for injunction is an equitable relief\tRatio of the decision\nThe courts while passing a decree for permanent injunction would avoid multiplicity of proceedings\tRatio of the decision\nThe court while passing such a decree,is obligated to consider the statutory provisions governing the same\tRatio of the decision\nFor the said purpose,it must be noticed as to what is a copyright and in respect of the matters the same cannot be claimed or otherwise the same is lodged by conditions and subject to statutory limitation\tRatio of the decision\nIn R.G.Anand vs\tPrecedent\nM/s\tPrecedent\nDelux Films & ors.[(1978\tPrecedent\n4 SCC 118]1978 Indlaw SC 294,this Court held: \"Thus,on a careful consideration and elucidation of the various authorities and the case law on the subject discussed above,the following propositions emerge: 1.There can be no copyright in an idea,subject-matter,themes,plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form,manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the copyrighted work\tPrecedent\n2.Where the same idea is being developed in a different manner,it is manifest that the source being common,similarities are bound to occur\tPrecedent\nIn such a case the courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work\tPrecedent\nIf the defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright\tPrecedent\nIn other words,in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy\tPrecedent\n3.One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader,spectator or the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original\tPrecedent\n4.Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work,no question of violation of copyright arises\tPrecedent\n5.Where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two works there are also material and broad dissimilarities which negative the intention to copy the original and the coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly incidental\tPrecedent\nno infringement of the copyright comes into existence\tPrecedent\n6.As\tPrecedent\na violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the case-law discussed above\tPrecedent\n7.Where\tPrecedent\nhowever the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage play by a film producer or a director the task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy\tPrecedent\nIt is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much broader prospective,wider field and a bigger background where the defendants can by introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and complexion different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has expressed the idea\tPrecedent\nEven so,if the viewer after seeing the film gets a totality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of the original play,violation of the copyright may be said to be proved\tPrecedent\nYet again in Eastern Book Company & ors vs\tPrecedent\nD.B.Modak & Anr.[(2008\tPrecedent\n1 SCC 1]2007 Indlaw SC 1341,this Court held: \"The Copyright Act is not concerned with the original idea but with the expression of thought\tPrecedent\nCopyright has nothing to do with originality or literary merit\tPrecedent\nCopyrighted material is that what is created by the author by his own skill,labour and investment of capital,maybe it is a derivative work which gives a flavour of creativity\tPrecedent\nThe copyright work which comes into being should be original in the sense that by virtue of selection,coordination or arrangement of pre-existing data contained in the work,a work somewhat different in character is produced by the author\tPrecedent\nOn the face of the provisions of the Copyright Act,1957,we think that the principle laid down by the Canadian Court would be applicable in copyright of the judgments of the Apex Court\tPrecedent\nWe make it clear that the decision of ours would be confined to the judgments of the courts which are in the public domain as by virtue of Section 52 of the Act there is no copyright in the original text of the judgments\tPrecedent\nTo claim copyright in a compilation,the author must produce the material with exercise of his skill and judgment which may not be creativity in the sense that it is novel or non-obvious,but at the same time it is not a product of merely labour and capital\tPrecedent\nThe derivative work produced by the author must have some distinguishable features and flavour to raw text of the judgments delivered by the court\tPrecedent\nThe trivial variation or inputs put in the judgment would not satisfy the test of copyright of an author\tPrecedent\nThe High Court,in our opinion,should have clarified that the appellants can also take the statutory benefit of the provisions contained in clauses (a),(i) and (l) of sub-section (1) of Section 52 of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nSection 52 of the Act provides for certain acts which would not constitute an infringement of copyright\tRatio of the decision\nWhen a fair dealing is made,inter alia,of a literary or dramatic work for the purpose of private use including research and criticism or review,whether of that work or of any other work,the right in terms of the provisions of the said Act cannot be claimed\tRatio of the decision\nThus,if some performance or dance is carried out within the purview of the said clause,the order of injunction shall not be applicable\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly,appellant being an educational institution,if the dance is performed within the meaning of provisions of clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 52 of the Act strictly,the order of injunction shall not apply thereto also\tRatio of the decision\nYet again,if such performance is conducted before a non-paying audience by the appellant,which is an institution if it comes within the purview of amateur club or society,the same would not constitute any violation of the said order of injunction\tRatio of the decision\nWith the aforementioned modification in the order of injunction,this appeal is dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nHowever,in the facts and circumstances of the case,there shall be no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

changed from Jupiter Infosys Limited to Jupiter International Limited and a certificate to that effect has been issued by the Registrar of Companies,Kolkata under the Companies Act,1956 and no dispute remains between the parties under the trade mark\tFacts\nThe relevant statement made in the affidavit dated July 14,2003 (we were informed that the date of the affidavit is July 14,2004) reads as follows: \" That in the meantime the defendant has already changed the Trade Mark namely \"Jupiter International Ltd.\" in place of \"Jupiter Infosys Ltd\tFacts\nThe copy of the incorporation on change of name which was issued by the registrar of the Companies are being marked and annexed herewith as Annexure A\tFacts\nThat now there is no dispute between the plaintiff and defendant under the Trade Mark\tFacts\nBased on this affidavit,the suit was partially decreed in favour of the appellant on November 10,2004\tFacts\nIn 2007,however,the first respondent filed a suit in the Court of Additional District Judge,Delhi for setting aside the decree dated November 10,2004.That suit is said to be pending\tFacts\nThe IPAB proceeded with the matter in light of the issues that were already framed by the High Court and heard the parties\tFacts\nThe IPAB in the impugned order while dealing with the plea of limitation raised by the appellant held that the first respondent was the appropriate aggrieved party in the matter in view of the fresh cause of action having arisen to the first respondent on filing of Civil Suit No.71 of 2001 by the appellant before the Madras High Court\tFacts\nThe IPAB in the impugned order held that the trade mark Nos.475269,475267 and 484837 have not been used by the appellant for more than a period of five years and one month and the appellant also failed to make out that it had been in manufacturing or trading of the goods for which it had taken Registration Nos.475269,475267 and 484837.Consequently,the IPAB allowed the applications made by the first respondent purportedly under Section 46(1)(b) of The 1958 Act and directed the Registrar to remove these registrations from the register\tFacts\nWe heard Mr\tFacts\nAkhil Sibal,learned counsel for the appellant and Mr\tFacts\nVaibhav Gaggar,learned counsel for the first respondent at quite some length\tFacts\nMr\tArgument\nAkhil Sibal,learned counsel for the appellant argued that an application for rectification,whether under Section 46 or Section 56 of The 1958 Act,can only be preferred by a 'person aggrieved'; the applicant must not only be a person aggrieved on the date of the application but must continue to remain a person aggrieved until such time as the rectification application is finally decided\tArgument\nHe contended that the first respondent is not shown to have ever traded or intended to trade in any goods covered by the appellant's registrations under Classes 7 and 16 and as such the first respondent is not a 'person aggrieved' with regard to the appellant's registrations under these two classes\tArgument\nAs regards Class 9 he would submit that in view of the affidavit filed by the first respondent on July 14,2004 in the Court of Additional District Judge,Delhi the first respondent ceases to be an aggrieved person on the date of consideration of the rectification application\tArgument\nLearned counsel heavily relied upon two decisions of this Court: (1) Hardie Trading Ltd.& Anr.v\tArgument\nAddisons Paint & Chemicals Ltd.(2003) 11 SCC 92) 2003 Indlaw SC 756 and (2) Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba v\tArgument\nTosiba Appliances Company & Ors.(2008) 10 SCC 766) 2008 Indlaw SC 1395\tArgument\nAssailing the finding of the IPAB as regards non-use by the appellant during the relevant period,learned counsel for the appellant argued that the said finding was erroneous on legal as well as factual premise\tArgument\nHe contended that the IPAB erred in holding that software was a 'service' and the subject registrations were in relation to goods without considering the wide definition of 'goods' provided under Section 2(g) of The 1958 Act\tArgument\nAkhil Sibal argued that the IPAB committed grave error in relying upon the provisions of the 1999 Act and the Trade Marks Rules,2002 when these provisions were not applicable as the applications were filed under The 1958 Act\tArgument\nAccording to him,the IPAB sought to rely upon 'computer programming' which is a 'service' enumerated in Class 42,without considering the distinction between a 'computer programme' and 'computer programming' and without noticing the entry 'computer' under Class 9 which falls within 'goods'.Learned counsel would submit that in examining the question of non-use under Section 46(1)(b),the IPAB failed to consider that the requisite use must be 'in relation to goods' under registration,which is extensively defined under Section 2(2)(b) of The 1958 Act\tArgument\nAkhil Sibal,learned counsel also argued that the IPAB failed to have regard to the proviso to Section 46(1),in terms of which it is open to the registered proprietor to rely upon use of the registered trade mark during the relevant period in relation to 'goods of the same description',in order to resist an application for rectification\tArgument\nHe contended that the IPAB failed to apply proper legal tests for determining 'goods of the same description' and had that been done it would be evident that 'computer software' amounts to 'goods of the same description' as 'computer hardware'.In this regard,he relied upon M/s\tArgument\nEagle Potteries\tArgument\nPrivate Ltd.v\tArgument\nM/s\tArgument\nEagle Flask Industries Pvt\tArgument\nLtd.(AIR 1993 Bombay 185); 1992 Indlaw MUM 6327 Lever Brothers,Port Sunlight Ld.v\tArgument\nSunniwite Products Ld.(1949) 66 RPC 84\tArgument\nThe Ritz Hotel v\tArgument\nCharles of the Ritz  (1989\tArgument\nRPC 333) and Australian Wine Importers' Trade Mark\tArgument\n6 RPC 311\tArgument\nLearned counsel for the appellant also submitted that in any view of the matter,the IPAB erred in exercising its discretion under Section 46 of The 1958 Act without taking into consideration the aspect of public interest\tArgument\nHe argued that the IPAB ought to have considered whether use of mark 'Infosys' by the first respondent on computer hardware would create confusion in the mind of the consumers that they might be led to believe that the said hardware is manufactured by the appellant\tArgument\nLearned counsel,thus,submitted that the impugned order is unsustainable and liable to be set aside\tArgument\nOn the other hand,an objection is raised in the written submissions on behalf of the first respondent and reference was made in support of the objection to seven Judge Bench decision of this Court in L.Chandrakumar v\tArgument\nUnion of India & Ors.(1997) 3 SCC 261) 1997 Indlaw SC 2816 that challenge to the order of IPAB directly in the appeal before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution is barred\tArgument\nIn reply to the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant,Mr\tArgument\nVaibhav Gaggar,learned counsel for the first respondent strenuously urged that the plea of 'aggrieved person' is a new plea and raised substantially for the first time before this Court\tArgument\nHe argued that the appellant has not taken the plea of the first respondent not being a 'person aggrieved' with respect to filing of the applications for rectification before the IPAB; merely urging the plea that the first respondent has no locus standi in the written submissions before the IPAB is not sufficient\tArgument\nLearned counsel would submit that the appellant has,for the first time,argued before this Court that the first respondent is not a person aggrieved and/or not capable of maintaining the rectification proceedings with respect to each and every good for which the appellant has been registered since the first respondent has not been registered for all the goods\tArgument\nVaibhav Gaggar rather asserted that the first respondent is a person aggrieved in view of the fact that various suits for infringement have been filed by the appellant against the first respondent and on the date of the applications for rectification/removal of the subject registrations from the register,the suits were pending\tArgument\nWith reference to the affidavit dated July 14,2004 filed by the first respondent before the Court of Additional District Judge,he submitted that the said affidavit has no relevance in consideration as to whether the first respondent is an aggrieved person as Section 46 (1) of The 1958 Act relates only to the period upto the date of the filing of the rectification application and the rights of the parties crystallized at that stage itself\tArgument\nIn this regard,he relied upon a decision of the Madras High Court in Agha Hyder Hussain & Anr.v\tArgument\nOmar Khayyam Wineries (Pvt\tArgument\nLtd.& Anr.(AIR 1977 Mad 166\tArgument\n1976 Indlaw MAD 380\tArgument\nHe also placed reliance upon some more decisions viz; Ritz Hotel Ltd.(1989\tArgument\nRPC 333),Philosophy Di Alberta Ferretti (2003 R.P.C.15\tArgument\nKeystone Knitting Mills Trade Mark(1929 (1) Ch\tArgument\nD.92) and Motor Terms Company Pty\tArgument\nLimited.v\tArgument\nLiberty Insurance Ltd.(1967 116 C.L.R.177).Learned counsel for the first respondent further submitted that the affidavit dated July 14,2004 was not placed by the appellant before the IPAB nor any reference of the said affidavit has been made in the written submissions before the IPAB and the appellant also did not make any effort to amend the pleadings that the first respondent was not an aggrieved person\tArgument\nIt was contended by Mr\tArgument\nVaibhav Gaggar that even otherwise in view of the fraud perpetrated by the appellant qua the registrations in question,the issue as to whether the first respondent had a dispute with the trade mark or not pales into insignificance as the primary duty of the court is to maintain the 'purity of the register'.He argued that in a case such as the present one since the allegations against the appellant relate to trafficking,squatting and non-user,the scope of 'person aggrieved' has to be enlarged\tArgument\nLearned counsel submitted that the fact that the appellant continues to allege and that stance has not changed in the pleadings in SLP as well that the first respondent is an infringer,pilfriger,defrauder,someone who wants to ride on the goodwill of the appellant or someone who wants to mislead the public at large,there is no question of the first respondent ceasing to be a person aggrieved at any stage\tArgument\nVaibhav Gaggar,learned counsel for the first respondent contended that the appellant is registered as a 'manufacturer and trader' under Classes 7,9 and 16 even though,it is a company engaged in software only\tArgument\nMoreover,there is nothing on record to indicate linkage with the manufacturing or marketing of the goods for which the appellant is holding registration of subject trade marks\tArgument\nHe vehemently contended that goods in Classes 7,9 and 16 for which the appellant obtained registration were never used in the manner contemplated by The 1958 Act for almost 30 years and that would show the mala fide intention of the appellant in having the same registered for the purpose of squatting and trafficking\tArgument\nLearned counsel for the first respondent further argued that 'Infosys' is not an invented or a coined word; the said word is an abbreviation and combination of the words 'information system'; the word 'Infosys' has been used by various companies abroad as well as within India prior to incorporation of the appellant itself and hence cannot be called an invented word\tArgument\nIn this regard,he relied upon a decision of the Madras High Court in Nestle's Products (India\tArgument\nLtd.v\tArgument\nP.Thankaraja\tArgument\nAnr.(AIR 1978 Mad 336).He submitted that appellant is primarily in service industry which is unregistrable under The 1958 Act and since the appellant is not trading in the goods in respect of which it is registered,it cannot be said that the mark of the appellant is distinctive of its goods\tArgument\nIn any case,learned counsel would submit that the expression 'Infosys' is not descriptive expression\tArgument\nInsofar as discretion exercised by IPAB in ordering removal of the appellant's registrations from the register under Section 46(1)(b) of The 1958 Act is concerned,learned counsel for the first respondent submitted that this Court should not overturn the discretion so exercised by the IPAB keeping in view the dishonest and fraudulent conduct of the appellant\tArgument\nLastly,he submitted that although no cross objections or cross appeal has been filed,the first respondent has some grievance with regard to the order of the IPAB in not considering the case set up in the rectification/removal applications particularly with regard to Section 56 of The 1958 Act\tArgument\nHaving regard to the order that we intend to make,we are not persuaded to accept the objection raised on behalf of the first respondent that present appeal preferred directly before this Court from the impugned order passed by the IPAB is not maintainable and must be dismissed as such\tRatio of the decision\nPertinently,the notice was issued in the petitions for special leave to appeal to the respondents on November 1,2004.In response to the said notice the first respondent filed counter affidavit before this Court on March 11,2005 wherein no specific objection about invocation of jurisdiction of this Court directly has been taken\tFacts\nIn the counter affidavit a very vague objection in the following terms was raised: \"That the present petition apart from being false and misconceived lacks the necessary jurisdiction,hence deserves outright rejection\tFacts\nWe are afraid,this is hardly an objection about maintainability\tRatio of the decision\nApart from it,on September 12,2005 after hearing both parties,special leave was granted by this Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn the backdrop of these peculiar facts,in our view,it is not appropriate to relegate the  17 appellant at this distance of time to challenge the impugned order passed by the IPAB in writ petition before the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe objection about maintainability of the appeals is,accordingly,overruled\tRatio of the decision\nThe moot question which has been debated before us is whether or not,the first respondent is an aggrieved person\tRatio of the decision\nThat the first respondent filed composite applications under Sections 46 and 56 of The 1958 Act for rectification/removal of the trade mark 'Infosys' registered in Classes 7,9 and 16 is not in dispute\tRatio of the decision\nSections 46 and 56 read as follows : \"S.46.Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.--(1) Subject to the provisions of section\tStatute\n47,a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either: (a) that the trade mark was registered without any bona fide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or,in a case to which the provisions of section 45 apply,by the company concerned,and that there has,in fact,been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date one month before the date of the application; or (b) that up to a date one month before the date of the application,a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered  18  and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being: Provided that,except where the applicant has been permitted under sub-section (3) of section 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,the tribunal may refuse an application under clause (a) or clause (b) in relation to any goods,if it is shown that there has been,before the relevant date or during the relevant period,as the case may be,bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description,being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered\tStatute\n2) Where in relation to any goods in respect of which a trade mark is registered: (a) the circumstances referred to in clause (1) of sub-section (1) are shown to exist so far as regards non-use of the trade mark in relation to goods to be sold,or otherwise traded in,in a particular place in India (otherwise than for export from India),or in relation to goods to be exported to a particular market outside India; and (b) a person has been permitted under sub-section (3) of section 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of those goods under a registration extending to use in relation to goods to be so sold,or otherwise traded in,or in relation to goods to be so exported,or the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,on application by that person in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar,the tribunal may impose on the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark such limitations as it thinks proper for securing that that registration shall cease to extend to such use.19 (3\tStatute\nAn applicant shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of sub-section (1) or for the purposes of sub-section (2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates\tStatute\nS.56.Power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register.(1\tStatute\nOn application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved,the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention,or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto\tStatute\nAny person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry,or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause,or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register,or by any error or defect in any entry in the register,may apply in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar,and the tribunal may make such order for making,expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit\tStatute\nThe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register\tStatute\nThe tribunal,of its own motion,may,after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard,make any order referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2\tStatute\nAny order of the High Court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the Registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly\tStatute\nThe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in Part A of the register to Part B of the register\tStatute\nThe position that emerges from the above provisions is this\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the application is under Section 46 or under Section 56 or a composite application under both Sections,it is a pre-requisite that the applicant must be a person aggrieved\tRatio of the decision\nSection 46(1) of The 1958 Act enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non use as stated in Clause (a) and/or Clause (b).To be an aggrieved person under Section 46,he must be one whose interest is affected in some possible way; it must not be a fanciful suggestion of grievance\tRatio of the decision\nA likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant by such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of locus standi\tRatio of the decision\nIn Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (11th edition) at page 166,the legal position with regard to 'person aggrieved' has been summarized thus The persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in some way or the other substantially interested in having the mark removed where it is a question of removal from the register; including all persons who would be substantially damaged if the mark remained,and all trade rivals over whom an advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the benefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled\tRatio of the decision\nWe accept the above statement of law\tRatio of the decision\nInsofar as Section 56 is concerned,it provides for varying situations in which the person aggrieved may apply for rectification of the registered trade mark from the register\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough both Sections,namely,Sections 46 and 56 require 'person aggrieved' to apply for removal of the registered trade mark from the register or rectification of a trade mark in the register,the expression 'person aggrieved' for the purposes of these two Sections has different connotations\tRatio of the decision\nThe interpretation of the expression 'person aggrieved' occurring in Sections 46 and 56 has come up for consideration before this Court on more than one occasion\tRatio of the decision\nIn Hardie Trading Ltd 2003 Indlaw SC 756.(2003) 11 SCC 92),this Court stated as follows: \" The phrase \"person aggrieved\" is a common enough statutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal\tPrecedent\nThe phrase has been variously construed depending on the context in which it occurs\tPrecedent\nThree sections viz\tPrecedent\nSections 46,56 and 69 of the Act contain the phrase\tPrecedent\nSection 46 deals with the removal of a registered trade mark from the Register on the ground of non-use\tPrecedent\nThis section presupposes that the registration which was validly made is liable to be taken off by subsequent non-user\tPrecedent\nSection 56 on the other hand deals with situations where the initial registration should not have been or was incorrectly made\tPrecedent\nThe situations covered by this section include: (a) the contravention or failure to observe a condition for registration; (b) the absence of an entry; (c) an entry made without sufficient cause; (d) a wrong entry; and (e) any error or defect in the entry\tPrecedent\nSuch type of actions are commenced for the \"purity of the Register\" which it is in public interest to maintain\tPrecedent\nApplications under Sections 46 and 56 may be made to the Registrar who is competent to grant the relief.\"Persons aggrieved\" may also apply for cancellation or varying an entry in the Register relating to a certification trade mark to the Central Government in certain circumstances\tPrecedent\nSince we are not concerned with a certification trade mark,the process for registration of which is entirely different,we may exclude the interpretation of the phrase \"person aggrieved\" occurring in Section 69 from consideration for the purposes of this judgment\tPrecedent\nIn our opinion the phrase \"person aggrieved\" for the purposes of removal on the ground of non-use under Section 46 has a different connotation from the phrase used in Section 56 for cancelling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or remaining in the Register\tPrecedent\nIn the latter case the locus standi would be ascertained liberally,since it would not only be against the interest of other persons carrying on the same trade but also in the interest of the public to have such wrongful entry removed\tPrecedent\nIt was in this sense that the House of Lords defined \"person aggrieved\" in the matter of Powell's Trade Mark: \"...although they were no doubt inserted to prevent officious interference by those who had no interest at all in the register being correct,and to exclude a mere common informer,it is undoubtedly of public interest that they should not be unduly limited,inasmuch as it is a public mischief that there should remain upon the register a mark which ought not to be there,and by which many persons may be affected,who,nevertheless,would not be willing to enter upon the risk and expense of litigation\tPrecedent\nWhenever it can be shown,as here,that the applicant is in the same trade as the person who has registered the trade mark,and wherever the trade mark,if remaining on the register,would,or might,limit the legal rights of the applicant,so that by reason of the existence of the entry on the register he could not lawfully do that which,but for the existence of the mark upon the register,he could lawfully do,it appears to me he has a locus standi to be heard as a person aggrieved\tPrecedent\nBut if the ground for rectification is merely based on non-user i.e.under Section 46 of the Act,that is not really on account of any public mischief by way of an incorrect entry\tRatio of the decision\nThe non-user does not by itself render the entry incorrect but it gives a right to a person whose interest is affected to apply for its removal\tRatio of the decision\nAn applicant must therefore show that \"in some possible way he may be damaged or injured if the trade mark is allowed to stand; and by 'possible' I mean possible in a practical sense,and not merely in a fantastic view\tRatio of the decision\nAll cases of this kind,where the original registration is not illegal or improper,ought to be considered as questions of common sense,to a certain extent,at any rate; and I think the applicants ought to show something approaching a sufficient or proper reason for applying to have the trade mark expunged\tRatio of the decision\nIt certainly is not sufficient reason that they are at loggerheads with the respondents or desire in some way to injure them\tRatio of the decision\nAddisons' application was one under Section 46 and the test to determine whether the applicant was a \"person aggrieved\" within the meaning of that section should have been the one laid down by Romer,J.in Wright case and not the one propounded by the House of Lords in the matter of Powell's Trade Mark\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court and the Joint Registrar fell into error in not drawing this distinction\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,it is not necessary to dilate on this aspect of the matter as the appellant has really argued on the second and third aspects of Section 46 viz.the alleged non-use of the trade marks by Hardie and special circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of Hardie Trading Ltd 2003 Indlaw SC 756.1,this Court approved the test applied by Romer,J.in The Royal Baking Powder Company v\tRatio of the decision\nWright,Crossley,and Co.(1898\tRatio of the decision\n15 RPC 677),which has been reproduced in the report\tRatio of the decision\nWe respectfully agree\tRatio of the decision\nHardie Trading Ltd 2003 Indlaw SC 756.1 has been followed by this Court in a recent decision in the case of Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba  (2008) 10 SCC 766) 2008 Indlaw SC 1395\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court stated that Section 46 speaks for private interest while Section 56 speaks of a public interest\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that the appellant in opposition to the applications for removal/rectification of trade mark did not specifically challenge in its counter affidavits the locus standi of the first respondent to be heard as a person aggrieved\tRatio of the decision\nObviously,in the absence of any specific objection by the appellant to that effect,no specific issue was framed by the High Court whether the applicant was an aggrieved person\tRatio of the decision\nThe applications having been transferred to the IPAB in terms of Section 100 of the 1999 Act,the IPAB examined the matter in light of the issues that were framed by the High Court although in the written submissions before it,the objection was raised that the first respondent has ceased to have locus standi in view of the subsequent events,particularly change of the name of the first respondent from Jupiter Infosys Ltd.to Jupiter International Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nThe question is,whether in these circumstances it was incumbent upon the IPAB to consider and satisfy itself about the locus standi of the first respondent to be heard as a person aggrieved\tRatio of the decision\nIn our considered view,it was\tRatio of the decision\nIn the first place,when the first respondent applied for rectification/removal in respect of three registrations in Classes 7,9 and 16,it must have shown in respect of each of them that it is a 'person aggrieved' and the IPAB must have separately considered in respect of each registration the locus standi of the first respondent as the considerations for each entry might not have been common\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly,and more importantly,during the pendency of the applications,certain events had taken place which had some bearing on the question of locus standi of the first respondent insofar as invocation of Section 46 (1) of The 1958 Act is concerned\tRatio of the decision\nIn the affidavit filed by the first respondent on July 14,2004 before the Court of Additional District Judge,Delhi an unequivocal and categorical statement has been made that now there is no dispute between the plaintiff (appellant herein) and defendant (first respondent herein) under the Trade Mark and that defendant has already changed the Trade Mark namely \"Jupiter International Ltd.\" in place of \"Jupiter Infosys Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nIn terms of Section 46(1),not only that the applicant has to show that he is an aggrieved person as his interest is being affected but the IPAB must also be satisfied,before it directs the removal of registered trade mark,that the applicant is an aggrieved person before it invokes the power in directing the removal of the  26 registered trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nThis is so because the pre-requisite for exercise of power under Section 46(1) is that the applicant is a person aggrieved\tRatio of the decision\nThe question then arises,whether it is sufficient for the applicant to show that he is a person aggrieved when he makes his application or he must continue to remain a person aggrieved until such time as the rectification/removal application is finally decided\tRatio of the decision\nIn our view,the grievance of the applicant when he invokes Section 46(1) must not only be taken to have existed on the date of making application but must continue to exist when such application is decided\tRatio of the decision\nIf during the pendency of such application,the applicant's cause of complaint does not survive or his grievance does not subsist due to his own action or the applicant has waived his right or he has lost his interest for any other reason,there may not be any justification for rectification as the registered trade mark cannot be said to operate prejudicially to his interest\tRatio of the decision\nIn re Apollinaris Company's Trade-Marks,while dealing with this aspect,Kekemich,J.stated : \".....because that is a remedy given to the person aggrieved through the interposition of the Court for the benefit of the 14 (1891) 2 Ch.186  27  applicant,and if at the date of the trial he has no cause of complaint it seems to be monstrous to suppose that the Court will rectify the register at his instance when it can do him no good to rectify,and when the retention on the register can do him no harm merely because at the date of his application he may have had some grievance\tPrecedent\nWe concur with the above statement\tRatio of the decision\nIn the circumstances,we are satisfied that the applications made by the first respondent for rectification/removal of the subject trade marks from the register need to be considered afresh by the IPAB in accordance with law and the observations made above\tRatio of the decision\nSince the first respondent has also grievance in connection with the impugned order particularly with regard to non-consideration of its case under Section 56 of The 1958 Act,we refrain from going into the merits of the diverse contentions raised before us and leave the parties to agitate these contentions before the IPAB\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of the above,these appeals are allowed in part and the impugned order dated September 9,2004 is set aside\tRuling by Present Court\nThe applications being TRA Nos.25 to 27 of 2003 (OP Nos.764 to 766 of 2001) are restored to the file of Intellectual Property Appellate Board,Chennai for hearing and disposal afresh in accordance with law\tRuling by Present Court\nThe parties shall bear their own costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

No.348 of 1973,which arose out of Regular Civil Suit No.921 of 1966 filed in the Court of Joint Civil Judge,Baroda (Civil Court) by the appellant herein as plaintiff against respondents 1 and 2 herein\tFacts\ndefendants 1 and 2 for redemption of suit properties which were mortgaged as security for certain monies borrowed by the plaintiff from defendant-l under two deeds of mortgage executed in the year 1961\tFacts\nPlaintiff filed the suit for redemption of the said mortgages in the year 1966.Defendant-2,brother of defendantI had been joined in that suit on the allegation that the latter was put in possession of mortgage properties by the former subsequent to the coming into existence of the mortgages\tFacts\nThat suit was resisted by the defendants,each of them having filed separate written statements which in sub-stance did not differ from each other\tFacts\nThe defence in those written statements was that defendant-l and his family members had become tenants of the suit properties in the year 1959-1960 and had continued to be such tenants at the time of mortgage deeds executed in respect of those properties in the year 1961 and thereafter\tFacts\nIt was also claimed therein that they had become owners of the said properties when the plaintiff in the year 1962 sold those properties to defendant-1 by receiving a sum of Rs.4,400/-as consideration for the sale\tFacts\nEven if the sale of said properties in favour of defendant-l,it was asserted therein,was not proved,they continued to be tenants of the said properties on the date of suit as they were tenants even before the date of coming into existence of the mortgages\tFacts\nThe issue relating to their claim that they were tenants of the said properties -the agricultural lands,as urged therein,had to be referred by the Civil Court to the Mamlatdar under section 85-A of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act,1948 -\"the BT & AL Act\" for recording his finding thereon and the suit had to be stayed pending receipt of the finding thereon so that the suit may be finally disposed of on the basis of such finding\tFacts\nThe Civil Court notwithstanding the defence of the defendants taken in their written statements that the suit had to be stayed for obtaining the finding on their claim of tenancy under the BT & AL Act,framed the issues in the suit on the basis of the pleadings of the parties and after trial recorded its findings thereon\tFacts\nSuch findings were firstly,that the defendants had failed to prove that the suit properties were sold in favour of defendant-l subsequent to the giving of security of those properties in his favour under the mortgage deeds; secondly,that the defendants had failed to prove the past tenancy of the suit properties on its view that what was pleaded by them in the written statements was tenancy prior to the date of filing of the suit; and thirdly,that the mortgages of the suit properties were mortgages by 'conditional sale\tFacts\nOn the basis of findings so recorded by the Civil\tFacts\nCourt,it also made a preliminary decree in favour of the plaintiff for redemption of the suit properties\tFacts\nThough the defendants filed an appeal in the Court of the District Judge,Baroda against the said preliminary decree that appeal came to be dismissed on August 17,1972 affirming the judgment and decree of the Civil Court\tFacts\nHowever,the defendants questioned the judgments and decrees of the trial court and the appellate court by filing a second appeal against the same in the High Court of Gujarat\tFacts\nA learned single Judge of the High Court,who heard the second appeal,while upheld the concurrent findings of the courts below that the deeds of mortgage executed by the plaintiff in respect of the suit properties in favour of defendant-l were mortgages by conditional sale and the defendants had failed to prove that there was sale of the suit properties in their favour subsequent to the coming into existence of the said mortgages,found that the defendants had raised in their written statements the plea that they were tenants not only prior to the date of suit but also at the time of the filing of the suit and having regard to that plea the suit ought to have been stayed by the Civil Court and the issue of tenancy should have been referred to the Mamlatdar for obtaining a finding from him thereon both under section 85-A of the BT\tRuling by Lower Court\nAL Act as it stood before its amendment at the time of filing of the suit and as it stood after its amendment after the filing of the suit\tRuling by Lower Court\nConsequently,the learned single Judge set aside the judgments and decrees of the trial court and the appellate court relating to the issue of tenancy raised by the defendants in the suit and remanded the case to the Civil Court (trial court) directing it to refer the issue of such tenancy to the Mamlatdar,Baroda for his determination and to stay all further proceedings in the suit till he got the finding from the Mamlatdar on that tenancy issue and thereafter to proceed to dispose of that suit in the light of that finding and the other findings recorded by the appellate court (District Judge\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt is the Judgment and Order of the learned single Judge of the High Court by which he allowed the Second Appeal and remanded the suit,which is appealed against in this Civil Appeal of the plaintiff as is stated at the outset\tFacts\nNo controversy is raised in this appeal as regards the findings of the Civil Court that the deeds of mortgage executed by the plaintiff in respect of the suit properties were mortgages by conditional sale\tRatio of the decision\nSpecific case pleaded by the plaintiff in the plaint as regards possession of the suit properties held by tenants was that their possession which was with the plaintiff was given to defendant-l on the execution of the deeds of mortgage by conditional sale in his favour\tRatio of the decision\nIn any event,it was not the case of the plaintiff that defendant-l was a tenant of the suit properties and hc surrendered his possession of the suit properties either expressly or impliedly and the possession so obtained by the plaintiff was re-delivered to defendant-l in pursuance of the mortgages by conditional sale executed in his favour\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,the arguments addressed before us on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant in support of the appeal by learned Senior Counsel Mr\tArgument\nS.K.Dholakia were these: That defendant-l\tArgument\nrespondent-l although was in possession of the suit properties\tArgument\nagricultural lands at the time of execution of the deeds of mortgage by conditional sale in his favour because of the coming into existence of such mortgages there occurred merger of lease-hold rights of defendant-l in suit properties when he obtained those properties as mortgage security under the said mortgages and as a consequence he became a mortgagee in possession of those properties\tArgument\nAccording 10 him a mortgagee in possession being a person who cannot be deemed to be a tenant under section 4 of the BT & AL Act it was not open to the defendants to claim that they were the tenants of suit properties and if that be so question of raising issue of tenancy by the Civil Court in the suit before it did not arise at all nor was it necessary to refer such issue to the Mamlatdar under section 85-A of the BT & AL Act and stay the suit till receipt of the finding on such issue as was directed by the High Court in its judgment under appeal\tArgument\nIn support thereof,he sought to place reliance on the decisions of this Court in Shah Mathuradas Maganlal and Co.v\tArgument\nNagappa Shankarappa Malaga and Others 1976 Indlaw SC 400 and Gambangi Appalaswamy Naldu and Others v\tArgument\nBehara Venkataramanayya Patro\tArgument\nEven otherwise.it was argued by him that the Civil Court before whom the plaintiff had filed the suit for redemption of the suit properties could not have driven the plaintiff to the forum of Mamlatdar merely because the defendants had raised the plea that they were tenants of the suit properties -agricultural lands\tArgument\nAccording to him when the plaintiff had not admitted that the defendants were tenants of the suit properties,it was not open to the defendants to force the plaintiff who had a right to choose his forum to file a suit to go before another forum on the plea that jurisdiction lay before another forum,that is,Mamlatdar\tArgument\nIn this regard support was sought from the decision of this Court in Raizada Topandas and Another v\tArgument\nM/s\tArgument\nGorakhram Gokalchand.1963 Indlaw SC\tArgument\n379 He,therefore,urged that the High Court was not justified in upsetting the concurrent finding of the trial court and the appellate court that the defendants failed to prove their tenancy and remanding the case to the trial court directing it to refer the issue of tenancy to the Mamlatdar and stay the suit till the receipt of the finding in that regard from the Mamlatdar and then dispose of the suit\tArgument\nHence,the Judgment and Order of the High Court,according to him,was liable to be interfered with and set aside\tArgument\nHowever,learned counsel appearing for the defendants -respondents sought to refute the arguments advanced on half of the plaintiff-appellant\tRatio of the decision\nQuestions which arise for our consideration and decision in the light of the aforesaid arguments of learned counsel for the contesting parties admit of their formulations thus: (1).Does the lease-hold of a tenant (lessee) in a property merge in mortgage security if the same property is given by the landlord (lessor) to the tenant (lessee) as a mortgage security under a mortgage by conditional sale,as would debar the tenant from desisting the suit of the landlord -mortgagor for recovery of possession of such property by obtaining a decree for redemption of the mortgage\tRatio of the decision\n2).When a plea of tenancy is raised with regard to suit property,an agricultural land,by a defendant who claims to be a tenant of such property under the BT & AL Act and seeks a reference of that issue by the Civil Court to the Mamlatdar under that Act for obtaining a finding thereon,can the Civil Court decide such issue by itself and proceed to decide the suit on the basis of the finding thereon\tRatio of the decision\nAs the said questions could be dealt with appropriately with reference to the statutory provisions which bear upon them,it would be convenient to advert to such statutory provisions here\tRatio of the decision\nThe Transfer of Property Act,1882 (TP Act) \"111.A lease of immoveable property determines - (a\tStatute\nb\tStatute\nc\tStatute\nd) in case the

after the specified date,in any Civil' Court involves any issues which are required to be settled,decided or dealt with by any authority competent to settle,decide or deal with such issues.under this Act (hereinafter referred to as the 'competent authority\tStatute\nWe shall now proceed to deal with the aforesaid questions\tRatio of the decision\nQuestion (1\tRatio of the decision\nInterests of the lessee and the lessor in the whole of the property become vested at the same time in one person in the same right because of section 11 l(d) of the T.P.Act\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is enunciated in section 111 (d) of the T.P.Act cannot be doubted is the doctrine of merger\tRatio of the decision\nMerger takes place when a lesser estate is merged or drowned in a greater estate\tRatio of the decision\nLease-hold held by a tenant or a lessee being a lesser estate and the right of reversion of the landlord (lessor) being a higher estate,the lessee's lease-hold right in respect of the property merges in reversion when that right of reversion,i.e.,the landlord's (lessor's) right of reversion comes to the tenant or lessee which happens when the landlord having a right to sell his reversion to the tenant holding the lease-hold sells the whole of it to the tenant (lessee).But,in view of the arguments advanced on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant,what has to be seen is if the landlord of a property,the lease-hold of which is already with the tenant,gives that very property as mortgage security to the tenant (lessee) by executing a mortgage by a conditional sale for the amount borrowed by him from the latter,does merger of lease-hold right in that mortgage security occur\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the landlord mortgages the lease-hold property of the tenant to the tenant himself,he does not part with the right of reversion which he has in respect of that property\tRatio of the decision\nIf that be so,merger of lease-hold estate in reversion cannot arise,inasmuch as,there cannot be any inconsistency or incompatibility in one person being the tenant and also the mortgagee of the same property,for in that event instead of the tenant paying rent to the landlord he may adjust it against the amount claimable by him as a mortgagee from the landlord\tRatio of the decision\nMoreover,if a lessee of a property takes a mortgage of the sum property from the landlord,it would be unreasonable to attribute to a tenant the intention to surrender the tenancy and to invoke the sophisticated doctrine of implied surrender as has been held by the Gujarat High Court in Patel Atmaram Nathudas v\tRatio of the decision\nBabubhai Keshavlal.1974 Indlaw GUJ 88\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,as has already been pointed out by us,the plaintiff-appellant did not claim that the defendants or any of them were in possession of the suit properties as tenants and there was a surrender by them of the possession either expressly or impliedly as would make the Court to come to the conclusion that the possession of the suit properties with the defendants was surrendered by them pursuant to the mortgage by conditional sale executed in their favour\tRatio of the decision\nIf that be the position,there can be no bar for the defendants to claim the right to continue in possession of the suit properties as tenants under the BT\tRatio of the decision\nAL Act even if the plaintiff could obtain a decree for redemption of the suit properties,which relief was sought in the suit\tRatio of the decision\nThe decision of this Court in Shah Mathuradas case 1976 Indlaw SC 400 (supra) and G.Appalaswamy case 1984 Indlaw SC 314 (supra) sought to be relied upon by learned counsel for the appellant -plaintiff in support of his arguments that there was a merger of the leasehold right of the tenant in the suit properties when he took mortgages of those properties from the landlord as would deny him the right to continue in possession of those properties as a tenant,instead of supporting his argument would go against it,as we shall presently point out\tRatio of the decision\nShah Mathuradas case 1976 Indlaw SC 400 (supra) was that where the respondent had executed a mortgage in favour of the appellant respecting a premises of which he was a tenant\tPrecedent\nIt was agreed under the terms of the mortgage deed that no interest need be paid by the respondent since the premises,the possession of which was given to the tenant pursuant to the mortgage was to be enjoyed in lieu of interest payable on the mortgage\tRatio of the decision\nWhen suit for redemption of the premises was filed by the respondent the appellant claimed,that after redemption,he was entitled to remain in possession of the premises because of the subsistence of his previous tenancy right\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court held that the mortgage deed established beyond doubt that there was no subsistence or continuation of lease in that there was delivery of possession by the tenant to the landlord immediately before the mortgage and redelivery of possession to the tenant of the premises made by the landlord was pursuant to the mortgage as a mortgagee and not as a tenant\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly,this Court held that the appellant was not entitled to retain after redemption possession of the mortgage-property by reason of his previous right to be in its possession as a tenant\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case as we have pointed out earlier,when no surrender of possession of the suit properties had taken place before the coming into existence of mortgages in favour of the lessor -mortgagor,when no redelivery of possession had been given pursuant to the mortgage to the-tenant,the decision under consideration can be of no assistance to the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nSince the following observations in the said case confirm the view we have taken on non-merger,they can be excerpted: \"For a merger to arise,it is necessary that a lesser estate and a higher estate should merge in one person at one and the same time and in the same right,and no interest in the property should remain outside\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of a lease the estate that is in the lessor is a reversion\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of a mortgage the estate that is outstanding is the equity of redemption of the mortgagor\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,there cannot be a merger of lease and mortgage in respect of the same property since neither of them is a higher or lesser estate than the other\tRatio of the decision\nComing to G.Appalaswamy case 1984 Indlaw SC 314 (supra) which considered the question whether a sitting tenant who took property by a possessory or usufructuary mortgage in his favour was liable to deliver physical possession upon redemption to the mortgagor\tPrecedent\nformer lessor).This Court dealing with the said question said that all depends upon whether there was an implied surrender of the lessee's rights when the usufructuary mortgage was executed in his favour by the lessor-mortgagor and only if an implied surrender of lossee's rights could be inferred then the mortgagor would be entitled to have delivery of physical possession upon redemption but not otherwise\tPrecedent\nDealing with the question of non-merger this Court approved the ratio of the decision in Shah Mathuradas 1976 Indlaw SC 400 (supra) thus: \"In our view there can be no merger of a lease and a mortgage,even where the two transactions are in respect of the same property\tPrecedent\nIt is well-settled that.for a merger to arise,it is necessary that lesser estate and a higher estate should merge in one person at one and the same time and in the same right and no interest in the property should remain outstanding\tPrecedent\nIn the case of a lease,the estate that is outstanding in the lessor is the reversion; in the case of a mortgage,the estate that is outstanding is the equity of redemption of the mortgagor\tPrecedent\nAccordingly,there cannot be a merger of a lease and a mortgage in respect of the same property since neither of them is a higher or lesser estate than the other\tPrecedent\nEven if the rights of the lessee and the rights of the mortgagee in respect of a property were to be united in one person the reversion in regard to the lease and the equity of redemption in regard to the mortgage,would be outstanding in the owner of the property and accordingly,there would not be a complete fusion of all the rights of ownership in one person\tPrecedent\nHence,the lease-hold of a tenant (lessee) in a property does not merge in mortgage security of that property,even if it is given .to\tRatio of the decision\nhim by the landlord (lessor) on a mortgage by conditional sale as would debar the tenant from desisting the suit of the landlord mortgagor for recovery of possession of such property by obtaining decree for redemption of the mortgage\tRatio of the decision\nQuestion (2\tRatio of the decision\nThe argument which was strenuously advanced on behalf of the appellant -plaintiff was that in a suit for redemption filed by the mortgagor in a Civil Court in respect of property notwithstanding the plea of the defendants' claim that they were tenants of that property under the BT & AL Act and under the provisions of that Act the issue of tenancy had to be referred by the Civil Court to the Mamlatdar for recording a finding thereon and the Civil Court can proceed to dispose 0\tArgument\nthe suit only on the basis of the finding received from the Mamlatdar,the Civil Court itself can record its finding on the issue of tenancy and if the finding to be recorded had to go against the claim of tenancy,it would be permissible for the Civil Court to grant the decree for redemption sought by the plaintiff in the said suit\tArgument\nSupport was sought for the argument from the decision of this Court in Topandas case 1963 Indlaw SC 379 (supra\tArgument\nWe find it difficult to accept the said argument and the aforesaid decision of this Court relied upon in support thereof can render no assistance\tRatio of the decision\nThe only question which arose for decision in Topandas case 1963 Indlaw SC 379 (supra) was whether on a proper interpretation of section 28 of the Bombay Rents,Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control\tRatio of the decision\nAct,1947\tRatio of the decision\nthe Rents Control Act\",the Court of Small Causes\tRatio of the decision\nBombay had exclusive jurisdiction in dealing with the suit out of which the appeal had arisen\tRatio of the decision\nThere,the respondent -a partnership firm was in possession as a tenant of a shop at Mulji Jetha Market,Bombay\tRatio of the decision\nIt instituted a suit in the Bombay City Civil Court (not the Court of Small Causes,Bombay) praying for a declaration that it was in lawful possession of the shop and the appellants had no right to enter into or remain in possession of the shop and for grant of an injunction restraining the appellants from interfering with the respondent's possession\tRatio of the decision\nThe plaint averments were that appellant-1 (defendant-1) had appointed the respondent as his commission agent for the sale of the appellants' cloth in the shop in question\tRatio of the decision\nThe agreement was to remain in force for a period of four years\tRatio of the decision\nPursuant to the said agreement,the respondent had allowed the appellants,their family members,servants and agents to visit the shop only for the purpose of looking after the business of commission agency\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellants,despite being asked not to visit the shop after the expiry of the period in the concerned agreement,they continued to visit the shop and were preventing the respondent from having access to its various articles such as stock-in-trade,books of account,furniture,fixtures etc\tRatio of the decision\nThus according to the plaint,the appellants who .were merely licensees,had no right to enter into the shop after the expiry of the period of licence envisaged in the agreement\tRatio of the decision\nThe defence of the appellants (defendants) in substance was that the agreement on which reliance was placed by the respondents in their suit was a sham agreement and that the appellants in reality were the tenants of the shop and the relationship between the respondents and appellants was that of the landlord and tenant\tArgument\nThe further plea taken in the written statement by the appellants was that as the question involved in the suit related to the possession of premises as between a landlord and his tenant,the Court of Small Causes,Bombay,alone had jurisdiction to try the suit\tArgument\nThe appeal in this Court had arisen out of the finding recorded on that issue and in dealing with that matter this Court had.to consider the true effect of sub-section (1) of section 28 of the Rents Control Act to find whether it means that a defendant if raises a claim or question as to the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between him and plaintiff the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is ousted even though the plaintiff pleaded that there is only exclusive jurisdiction to decide the case with the Court of Small Causes,Bombay\tRatio of the decision\nDealing with the matter this Court referred.to the general principle which covers the question of jurisdiction at the inception of suits which was not disputed,thus: \"The plaintiff chooses his forum and files his suit\tRatio of the decision\nIf he establishes the correctness of his facts he will get his relief from the forum chosen\tRatio of the decision\nIf ...he frames his suit in a manner not warranted by the facts,and goes for his relief to a court which cannot grant him relief on the true facts,he will have his suit dismissed\tRatio of the decision\nThen there will be no question of returning the plaint for presentation to the proper court,for the plaint,as framed,would not justify the other kind of court to grant him the relief\tRatio of the decision\nIf it is found,on a trial on the merits so far as this issue of jurisdiction goes,that the facts alleged by the plaintiff are not true and the facts alleged by the defendants are true,and that the case is not cognizable by the.court,there will be two kinds of orders to be passed\tRatio of the decision\nIf the jurisdiction is only one relating to territorial limits or pecuniary limits,the plaint will be ordered to be returned for presentation to the proper court\tRatio of the decision\nIf,on the other hand,it is found that having regard to the nature of the suit it is not cognizable by the class of court to which the court belongs,the plaintiff's suit will have to be dismissed in its entirety\tRatio of the decision\nBy referring to the material portion of section 28 of the Rents Control Act the argument made on behalf of the appellants was found by this Court to be untenable by stating thus: \"We do not think that the section says or intends to say that the plea of the defendant will determine or change the forum\tRatio of the decision\nIt proceeds on the basis that exclusive jurisdiction is conferred on certain courts to decide all questions or claims under the Act as to parties,between whom there is or was a relationship of landlord and tenant\tRatio of the decision\nIt does not invest those courts with exclusive power to try questions of title such as questions as between the rightful owner and a trespasser or a licensee,for such questions do not arise under the Act\tRatio of the decision\nIf,therefore,the plaintiff in his plaint does not admit a relation which would attract any of the provisions of the Act on which the exclusive jurisdiction given under S.28 depends,we do not think that the defendant by his plea can force the plaintiff to go to a forum where on his averments he cannot go\tRatio of the decision\nThe interpretation canvassed for by the appellants will give rise to anomalous results; for example,the defendant may in every case force the plaintiff to go to the Court of Small Causes and secondly,if the Court of Small Causes finds against the defendant's plea,the plaint may have to be returned for presentation to the proper court for a second time.when one has regard to the provisions in Part II it seems reasonably clear that the exclusive jurisdiction conferred by S.28 is really dependent on an existing or previous relationship of landlord and tenant and on claims arising under the Act as between such parties\tRatio of the decision\nAs seen from the above observations this Court has held that it did not think that the section concerned says or intends to say that the plea of the defendant will determine or change the forum\tRuling by Present Court\nBut,if the provisions of the BT & AL Act which bear on the question of matters to be decided by the Mamlatdar are seen,they give no room for one even to think that those matters could be decided by a Civil Court when a question is raised in that behalf even by a defendant in a suit\tRuling by Present Court\nSection 70 of the BT & AL Act to which we have adverted already imposes a duty on the Mamlatdar to decide whether a person is an agriculturist or a tenant or a protected tenant or a permanent tenant when such person claims to be so under that Act\tRatio of the decision\nFurther,section 85 of the BT & AL Act to which also we have already adverted,in unequivocal terms says that in deciding any issue which is required to be decided by the Mamlatdar under the BT & AL Act no Civil Court has jurisdiction to decide it\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore,section 85A,as it stood prior to its amendment by Gujarat Amendment Act No.5 in the year 1973 and as stands thereafter,requires that if any suit instituted in Civil Court involves the question of tenancy of 'present' or 'past',as the case may be,the same being required to be decided or dealt with by an authority competent under the BT & AL Act,the Civil Court has to stay the suit and refer the issue to such competent authority for determination and after receiving the decision thereon to dispose of the suit in accordance with such decision\tRatio of the decision\nThus,the provisions in the BT & AL Act give no scope or room to think that the plea of tenancy if raised by the defendants in a suit in a Civil Court,the same could be decided by the Civil Court\tRatio of the decision\nThus we are constrained to answer the question in the negative by agreeing with the view expressed by the single Judge of the High Court in this regard in his Judgment and Order under appeal\tRatio of the decision\nConsequently,the Judgment and Order under appeal does not call for our interference\tRatio of the decision\nIn the result,we dismiss this appeal with costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

his house about six months earlier and had said all was not well between her and her husband, but she had not given any specific details\tFacts\nThe main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money and also harassment and beating to Bhimabai are her father and mother, viz\tRatio of the decision\nPW.1 Tukaram and PW.5 Sumanbai\tRatio of the decision\nIn his examination-in-chief PW.1 has said that whenever his daughter came to her parental home, she used to complain that she was being subjected to harassment by the appellants on account of some \"domestic reasons\" and further that her husband (appellant no.1) had told her that while coming back from her parental home she should bring Rs\tRatio of the decision\n1,000-1,200 for expenses and for manure as he had no sufficient money\tRatio of the decision\nPW.5 Sumanbai has deposed that Bhimabai was receiving ill-treatment as a result of \"domestic cause\" and to a specific question put by the Court as to what she meant by \"domestic cause\" she gave a reply that there was a demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc\tRatio of the decision\nIt is important to note that in her statement under Section 161 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. which was recorded on the very next day of the death of Bhimabai, this witness did not state that the cause for ill-treatment was \"a demand for money and a consequent beating\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence on record does not indicate that the police had any reason to favour the accused and deliberately omitted to mention about the alleged demand of money while recording the statement of PW.5 Sumanbai under Section 161 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence shows that the accused come from very humble background and they could not have exerted any kind of influence, financial or otherwise, upon the police so as to manage a statement favourable to them when in the course of investigation the statements of witnesses were being recorded under Section 161 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nAccepting the statements of father and mother on their face value that utmost which can be held is that the appellant no.1 had asked his wife Bhimabai to bring money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure\tRatio of the decision\nTwo essential ingredient of Section 304-B IPC, apart from others, are (i) death of women is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, and (ii) women is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for \"dowry\tStatute\nThe explanation appended to sub-section (1) of Section 304-B IPC says that \"dowry\" shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961\tStatute\nSection 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act reads as under :- \"2. Definition of \"dowry\" - In this Act \"dowry\" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly- (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or (b) by the parent of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include dowry or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (shariat) applies\tStatute\nIn view of the aforesaid definition of the word \"dowry\" any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential\tRatio of the decision\nBeing a penal provision it has to be strictly construed\tRatio of the decision\nDowry is a fairly well known social custom or practice in India\tRatio of the decision\nIt is well settled principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a particular trade, business or transaction and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business or transaction knows or understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning\tRatio of the decision\nSee Union of India v. Garware Nylons Ltd., AIR (1996\tRatio of the decision\nSC 3509 1996 Indlaw SC 2404 and Chemicals and Fibres of India v. Union of India, AIR (1997\tRatio of the decision\nSC 558 1991 Indlaw SC 861\tRatio of the decision\nA demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses of for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence adduced by the prosecution does not, therefore, show that any demand for \"dowry\" as defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure\tRatio of the decision\nSince an essential ingredient of Section 304-B IPC viz\tRatio of the decision\ndemand for dowry is not established, the conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that there is absolutely no evidence either direct or circumstantial to show that Bhimabai committed suicide\tArgument\nHe has submitted that the insecticide Thimet is extensively used by the farmers for preservation of crop and is kept stored in their houses and it could be a case where Thimet accidentally got mixed with some food item and was consumed by Bhaimabai\tArgument\nIt has thus been submitted that no offence under Section 306 IPC is made out against the appellants\tArgument\nWe do not consider it necessary to examine this question\tRatio of the decision\nAs already stated, the appellants were also charged under Sections 498-A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but were acquitted of the said charges by the learned Sessions Judge, which order has attained finality for the reason that the State did not prefer appeal against the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal before the High Court and also in this Court has been preferred by the appellants challenging their conviction under section 304-B read with section 34 IPC\tRatio of the decision\nIt has been held in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Thadi Narayan, AIR (1962\tPrecedent\nSC 240 1961 Indlaw SC 171 that Section 423(1)(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (which corresponds to Section 386(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) is clearly confined to cases of appeals preferred against orders of conviction and sentence, the powers conferred by this clause cannot be exercised for the purpose of reversing an order of acquittal passed in favour of a party in respect of an offence charged, in dealing with an appeal preferred by him against the order of conviction in respect of another offence charged and found proved\tPrecedent\nTherefore, we have refrained from expressing any opinion as to whether the appellants could be held guilty of having committed the offence under Section 498-A or 306 IPC on the basis of evidence available on record as their acquittal under the aforesaid charges has attained finality and cannot be reversed in the appeal filed by the appellants challenging their conviction under Section 304-B IPC\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of the discussion made above, the appeal is allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nThe judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of the High Court and the judgment and order dated 04 January 1993 of the learned Sessions Judge convicting the appellants under Section 304-B IPC are set aside and the appellants are acquitted of the said charge\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appellant no.1 is in custody\tRuling by Present Court\nHe shall be released forthwith unless wanted in some other case\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appellant no. 2 is on bail\tRuling by Present Court\nThe sureties and bail bonds furnished by her are discharged\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

            "text": "This appeal by special leave which is directed against the judgment and order dated April 24,1974 of the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras reversing the judgment and order dated April 19,1971 of the Single Judge of that Court passed in writ petition No.3822 of 1969 presented u/art.226 of the Constitution raises a complex but an interesting question relating to the construction of the phrases \"maternity benefit........for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day\" occurring in s.5(1) of the Maternity Benefits Act,1961\tFacts\nAct LIII of 1961) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') which in view of s.2(1) of the Act is the law applicable even to women workers employed in plantations\tFacts\nIt appears that in October,1967,Subbammal,respondent No.2 herein,who is a woman worker employed in Mount Stuart Estate (hereinafter referred to as 'the establishment'),which is carrying on plantation industry,was allowed leave of absence by the establishment on the basis of a notice given by her of her expected delivery which actually took place on December 16,1967.After her delivery,the respondent was paid by her employers on account of maternity benefit an amount equivalent to what she would have earned on the basis of her average daily wage in 72 working days falling within twelve week's of the maternity period\tFacts\nWhile calculating the aforesaid amount of maternity benefit,the establishment admittedly excluded twelve Sundays being wageless holidays,which fell during the period of the respondent's actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day\tFacts\nDissatisfied with this computation,the respondent made a representation to her employers claiming maternity benefit for the entire period of twelve weeks under the Act.i.e.for 84 days on the plea that a week consisted of seven days\tFacts\nAs her demand did not evoke a favourable response,the respondent applied to the Labour Court,Coimbatore,under section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act for redress of her grievance\tFacts\nThe claim preferred by the respondent was resisted by the appellant herein who contended that the respondent was admittedly working and was being paid only for six days in a week and that a pregnant woman worker is entitled to maternity benefit for 72 days which are the normal working days in twelve weeks and not for 84 days,as no wage is payable for the seventh day of the week i.e\tFacts\nSunday,which is a nonworking wageless holiday\tFacts\nBy its order dated February 26,1969,the Labour Court allowed the claim of the respondent\tFacts\nThereupon the establishment moved the High Court at Madras u\tFacts\nart.226 of the Constitution challenging the,decision of the Labour Court\tFacts\ncontending that the claim made by the respondent was untenable as normally a worker works only for six days in a week and the maternity benefit had to be computed only for 72 days\tFacts\nAs against this,the respondent pleaded that the computation had to be made not with reference to the Actual number of working days but with reference to total number of days covered by twelve weeks i.e.84 days\tFacts\nThe Single Judge of the High Court to whom the case was assigned allowed the petition holding that twelve weeks for which maternity benefit is provided for in subs.(3) of s.5 of the Act must be taken to mean twelve weeks of work and the computation of the benefit had to be made with reference to the Actual days on which the woman would have worked but for her inability\tFacts\nAggrieved by this decision,the respondent filed an appeal u/cl.15 of the Letters Patent which,as already stated,was allowed by the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court observing that the maternity benefit which the respondent was entitled to receive was for the period of her absence before delivery including the day of delivery and also six weeks thereafter,each week consisting of seven days including Sundays\tFacts\nDissatisfied with this decision,the establishment has,already stated,come up in appeal to this Court by special leave\tFacts\nWe have heard Mr\tFacts\nPai,learned counsel for the appellant as also Mr\tFacts\nBhatt,who in view of the default in appearance of respondent No.2 and the importance of the point involved in the case was appointed as amicus cruaie\tFacts\nWe place on record our deep appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered to us by both of them\tFacts\nAssailing the judgment and order under appeal,Mr\tArgument\nPai has urged that since legislative intent,as revealed from the scheme of s.5(1) of the Act is to compensate the woman worker who expects delivery for the loss that her forced absence from work on account of pregnancy and confinement may entail,the liability which has to be imposed on her employer cannot exceed the amount that she would have earned if she had not been compelled to avail of the maternity leave and since Sunday is a non-working wageless day,the employer cannot be made to pay for that day\tArgument\nHe has further urged that since u/s.5 (1) of the Act,the maternity benefit has to be computed with reference to the period of the workers' actual absence thereby meaning absence on days on which there was work excluding Sundays and the term 'week\" in the context of 'sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act is to be under stood as a week of work consisting of six days and in the instant case,respondent No.2 was working and earning wages for six days in a week,the seventh day being a wageless holiday,her claim cannot be sustained\tArgument\nIn support of his contention\tArgument\nMr\tArgument\nPai has referred us to the Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in Malayalam Plantations Ltd\tArgument\nCochin v\tRatio of the decision\nInspector of Plantation Mundakayam\tArgument\nOrs.,(1975\tArgument\nLab\tArgument\nI.C.848=A.I.R.1975\tArgument\nKer.86 1974 Indlaw KER 91,and to Convention No.103 concerning Maternity Protection Convention (Revised),1952 adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation\tArgument\nBhatt has,on the other hand,urged that the scheme of s.5 of the Act clearly indicates that a woman worker who expects delivery had to be paid maternity benefit for all the seven days of the week including Sundays falling within the ante-natal and post-natal periods specified in the s\tArgument\nFor a proper determination of the question involved in the appeal,it would,we think,be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Act which have a bearing on the subject matter of the controversy before US\tRatio of the decision\ns.2(1) of the Act makes the Act applicable to every establishment being a factory,mine or plantation (including any such establishment belonging to Government and to every establishment wherein persons are employed for the exhibition of equastrain acrobatic and other performance\tStatute\nSub-s.(2) of s.2 of the Act specifically excludes the applicability of the provisions of the Act to any factory or other establishment to which the provisions of the Employees State Insurance Act,1948 apply for the time being.s.3(n) of the Act defines \"wages\" as under :- \"3(n).--Wages means all remuneration paid or payable in cash to a woman,if the terms of the contract of employment,express or implied,were fulfilled and includes- (1) such cash allowances (including dearness allowance and house rent allowance) as a woman is for the time being entitled to\tStatute\n2) incentive bonus; and (3) the money value of the concessional supply of food-grains and other articles,but does not include\tStatute\ni) any bonus other than incentive bonus; (ii) over-time earnings and any deduction or payment on account of fines; (iii) any contribution paid or payable by the employer to any pension fund or provident fund or for the benefit of the woman under any law for the time being in force; and (iv) any gratuity payable on the termination of service\tStatute\nThe above definition,it would be noted,does not restrict the meaning of the term \"wages\" to contractual wages but gives the term a composite meaning covering all remunerations in the nature of cash allowances,incentive bonus and the money value of the concessional supply of foodgrains and other articles\tRatio of the decision\nS.4 of the Act which prohibits the employment of,or work by,woman during certain period lays down :- \"4.Employment of,or work by,woman prohibited during certain period.- (1) No employer shall knowingly employ a woman in any establishment during the six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery or her mis-carriage\tStatute\nNo woman shall work in any establishment during the six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery or

specified in sub-s.(4) any which is of an arduous nature or which involves long hours of standing,or which in any way is likely to interfere with her pregnancy or the normal development of the foetus,or is likely to cause her miscarriage or otherwise to adversely affect her health\tStatute\nThe period referred to in sub-s.(3) shall be- (a\tStatute\nthe period of one month immediately preceding the period of six weeks,before the date of her expected delivery; (b\tStatute\nany period during the said period of six weeks for which the pregnant woman does not avail of leave of absence

provisions of this Act,every woman shall be entitled to,and her employer shall be liable for,the payment of maternity benefit at the rate of the average daily wage for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day\tStatute\nEXPLANATION\tStatute\nFor the purpose of this sub-section,the average daily wage means the average of the woman's wages payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher\tStatute\nNo woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit unless she has actually worked in an establishment of the employer from whom she claims maternity benefit,for a period of not less than one hundred and sixty days in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery\tStatute\nProvided that the qualifying period of one hundred and sixty days aforesaid shall not apply to a woman who has immigrated into the State of Assam and was pregnant at the time of the immigration\tStatute\nFor the purpose of calculating under this sub-section,the days on which a woman has actually worked in the establishment,the days for which she has been laid off during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery shall be taken into account\tStatute\nThe maximum period for which any woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit shall be twelve weeks,that is to say,six weeks up to and including the day of her delivery and six weeks immediately following that day\tStatute\nProvided that where a woman dies during this period,the maternity benefit shall be payable only for the days up to and including the day of her death\tStatute\nProvided further that where a woman,having delivered of a child,dies during her delivery or during the period of six weeks immediately following the date of her delivery,leaving behind in either case the child,the employer shall be liable for the maternity benefit for the entire period of six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery but if the child also dies during the said period,then,for the days upto and including the day of the death of the child\tStatute\nS.6 of the Act which deals with notice of claim for maternity benefit and payment thereof is to the following effect :- \"6.Notice of claim for maternity benefit and payment thereof\tStatute\nAny woman employed in an establishment and entitled to maternity benefit under the provisions of this Act may give notice in writing in such form as may be prescribed,to her employer,stating that her maternity benefit and any other amount to which she may be entitled under this Act may be paid to her or to such person as she may nominate in the notice and that she will not work in any establishment during the period for which she receives' maternity benefit\tStatute\nIn the case of a woman who is pregnant,such notice shall state the date from which she will be absent from work,not being a date earlier than six weeks from the date of her expected delivery\tStatute\n3) Any woman who has not given the notice when she was pregnant may give such notice as soon as possible after the delivery\tStatute\nOn receipt of the notice,the employer shall permit such woman to absent herself from the establishment until the expiry of six weeks after the day of her delivery\tStatute\nThe amount of maternity benefit for the period preceding the date of her expected delivery shall be paid in advance by the employer to the woman on production of such proof as may be prescribed that the woman is pregnant,and the amount due for the subsequent period shall be paid by the employer to.the woman within forty-eight hours of production of such proof as may be prescribed that the woman has been delivered of a child\tStatute\n6) The failure to give notice under this section s not disentitle a woman to maternity benefit or any other amount under this Act if she is otherwise entitled to such benefit or amount and in any such case,an Inspector may either of his own motion or on an application made to him by the woman,order the payment of such benefit of amount within such period as may be specified in the order\tStatute\nThe provisions of s.5 of the Act quoted above make it clear that a woman worker who expects a child is entitled to maternity benefit for a maximum period of twelve weeks which is split up into two periods viz.prenatal and post-natal\tRatio of the decision\nThe first one i.e.prenatal or ante-natal period is limited to the period of woman's actual absence extending upto six weeks immediately preceding and including the day on which her delivery occurs and the second one which is postnatal compulsory period consists of six weeks immediately following the day of delivery\tRatio of the decision\nThe benefit has to be calculated for the aforesaid two periods on the basis of the average daily wage\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to the Explanation appended to s.5(1) of the Act,the average daily wage has to be computed taking into consideration the average of the woman's wager,.payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher\tStatute\nFor fixing the average daily wage,it has therefore first to be ascertained whether the wages with were paid or were payable to the woman was for 'time work' or for 'piece work'.It has next to be ascertained as to what were the cash wages paid or payable to her in terms of the definition contained in s.3 (n) of the Act for the days on which she worked during the period of three-calendar months immediately preceding the date of delivery,reckoned according to the British calendar month\tRatio of the decision\nThe total wages thus worked out are to be divided by the number of days in the aforesaid three calendar months in order to arrive at the average daily wage\tRatio of the decision\nAfter thus finding out the average daily wage,the liability of the employer in respect of the maternity benefit has to be calculated in terms of s.5 of the Act for both ore-natal and post-natal period indicated above\tRatio of the decision\nThe real though difficult question that calls for determination by us is as to what is the connotation of the term \"week\" occurring in sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act and whether the computation of the maternity benefit prescribed by the Act for the a foresaid two periods has to be made taking a \"week\" as signifying a cycle of seven days including a Sunday or a cycle of seven days minus a Sunday which is said to be a wageless day,As the Act does not contain any definition of the word \"week\",it has to be understood in its ordinary dictionary sense\tRatio of the decision\nIn the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Third Edition),the word \"week\" has been described as meaning \"the cycle of seven days,recognized in the calendar of the Jews and thence adopted in the calendars of Christian Mohammedan and various other peoples\tRatio of the decision\nA space of seven days,irrespective of the time from which it is reckoned\tRatio of the decision\nSeven days as a term for periodical payments (of wager,,rent,or the like),or as a unit of reckoning for time of work or service\tRatio of the decision\nIn Webster's New World Dictionary (1962 Edition),the meaning of the word \"week\" is given as \"a period of seven days,especially one beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday; the hours or days of work in a seven-day period\tRatio of the decision\nIn Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Third Edition),it is stated that (1) \"though a week usually means any consecutive seven days,it will sometimes be interpreted to mean the ordinary notion of a week reckoning from Sunday to Sunday and (2) probably,a week usually means seven clear days\tRatio of the decision\nA \"week\" according to Halsbury's Laws of England\tRatio of the decision\nThird Edi-tion) Volume 37 at p.84 is.strictly the time between midnight on Saturday and the same hour on the next succeeding Saturday,but the term is also applied to any period of seven successive days\tRatio of the decision\nBearing in mind the above mentioned dictionary or popular meaning of the term\tRatio of the decision\nweek\",we think that in the context of sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act,the term has to be taken to signify a cycle of seven days including Sundays\tRatio of the decision\nThe language in which the aforesaid sub-s.s are couched also shows that the Legislature intended that computation of maternity benefit is to be made for the entire period of the woman worker's actual absence i.e.for all the days including Sundays which may be wageless holidays falling within that period and not only for intermittent periods of six days thereby excluding Sundays falling within that period for if it were not so,the Legislature instead of using the words \"for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day\" would have used the words \"for the working days falling within the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day but excluding the wageless days\".Again the word \"period\" occurring in s.5(1) of the Act is a strong word\tRatio of the decision\nIt seems to emphasize,in our judgment,the continuous running of time and recurrence of the cycle of seven days\tRatio of the decision\nIt has also to be borne in mind in this connection that in interpreting provisions of beneficial pieces of legislation like the one in hand which is intended to achieve the object of doing social justice to women workers employed in the plantations and which squarely fall within the purview of Art.42 of the Constitution,the beneficent rule of construction which would enable the woman worker not only to subsist but also to make up her dissipated energy,nurse her child,preserve her efficiency as a worker and maintain the level of her previous efficiency and output has to be adopted by the Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe interpretation placed by us on the phraseology of sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act appears to us to be in conformity not only with the legislative intendment but also with Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Art.4 of Convention No.103 concerning Maternity Protection Convention\tStatute\nRevised),1952 adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation which are extracted below for facility of reference:- \"Art.4\tStatute\n1.While absent from work on maternity leave in accordance with the provisions of art.3,the woman shall be entitled to receive cash and medical benefits\tStatute\n2.The rates of cash benefit shall be fixed by national laws or regulations so as to ensure benefit sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of herself and her child in according with a suitable standard of living\tStatute\nThus we are of opinion that computation of maternity benefit has to be made for all the days including Sundays and rest days which may be wageless holidays comprised in the Actual period of absence of the woman extending upto six weeks preceding and including the day of delivery as also for all the days falling within the six weeks immediately following the day of delivery thereby ensuring that the woman worker gets for the said period not only the amount equalling 100 per cent of the wages which she was previously earning in terms of s.3 (n) of the Act but also the benefit of the wages for all the Sundays and rest days falling within the aforesaid two periods which would ultimately be conducive to the interests of both the woman worker and her employer\tRuling by Present Court\nIn view of what we have stated above,we cannot uphold the view of the law expressed by the Full Bench of Kerala High Court in Malayalam Plantations Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nInspector of Plantations Mundakayam & Ors.1974 Indlaw KER 91 (supra\tRatio of the decision\nIn

arising out of SLP (C) No.13314 of 1992\tFacts\nThe respondents are the members of one Sarkar family in the city of Calcutta\tFacts\nThe dispute centres around a fishery called Nalban Fishery\tFacts\nA suit for partition was filed by one of the Co-sharers of said Sarkar family in the High Court of Calcutta on 3.9.1955,which was registered as Suit No.2539 of 1955.The schedule of properties included the disputed Nalban Fishery\tFacts\nA learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court passed a preliminary decree in the said suit on 11.8.1960.One of the Co-sharers of the Sarkar family preferred an appeal against the preliminary decree before the Division Bench which was registered as Appeal No,200 of 1960.During the pendency of the aforesaid appeal the State of West\tFacts\nBengal requisitioned large extent of fisheries including the disputed Nalban Fishery on 5.11.1969 in exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the West Bengal Land Requisition and Acquisition Act of 1948 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Requisition Act').Pursuant to the aforesaid requisition order the State of West Bengal took possession of the Nalban Fishery on 8.11.1969.Members of the Sarkar family challenged the order of requisition by filing a writ petition in Calcutta High Court in November,1969 which was registered as Civil Rule No.7317 (W) of 1969.The aforesaid writ petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge\tFacts\nThe appeal to the Division Bench was preferred against the aforesaid order of dismissal which was registered as F.M.A.No.126

special leave petition\tFacts\nThe appeal arising out of the petition suit bearing Suit No.2539 of 1955 which had been registered as appeal No.200 of 1960 was finally disposed of by the Division Bench and the said order was assailed in this Court in SLP (C) Nos.5370 & 5371 of 1978.The said two appeals arising out of the said two special leave petitions were disposed of by order dated 18.4.1979 on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties on intervention of Shri Ashok Sen who appearing for one of the parties but it was indicated in the order that the State's right in relation to the fisheries will not be affected by the decree in question\tFacts\nThis Court further ordered: \"we again wish to re-emphasize that the terms of the decree shall not effect the rights of the State of West Bengal,in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question,if they have vested in State under the provisions of the West Bengal Estate Acquisition Act of 1953 (Act X of 1954\tRuling by Lower Court\nPrior to the passing of the aforesaid order on April 18,1979 while granting special leave petition on 10.11.1978 this Court had directed that the State of West Bengal will be made a party to the proceeding and further the Collector Parganas was appointed as Receiver in respect of the fisheries owned by the Sarkar family\tFacts\nThe Court had also further directed that the Collector will be the Receiver in respect of the fisheries which has not already been vested in the State and whose Possession has not already been taken over by the State\tFacts\nPursuant to the aforesaid order appointing Collector 24 Parganas as Receiver\tFacts\nthe Collector 24 Parganas took possession of the fisheries including Nalban Fishery as Receiver and submitted a compliance report dated 22.11.1978 to the Registrar of this Court\tFacts\nIt may be noted that Nalban Fishery had been requisitioned by the State of West Bengal under the provisions of Requisition Act since 5.11.1969 and possession thereof had been taken on 8.11.1969 and the Sarkar family had challenged the said order unsuccessfully which final by the dismissal of the special leave petition by this Court on 17.11.1972.On 25.5.1979 the Collector 24 Parganas who had been appointed as Receiver realised that he could not have taken possession of Nalban Fishery as Receiver since the said fishery had already been in possession of the State of West Bengal pursuant to requisition order dated 5.11.1969.Obviously,the earlier compliance report dated 20.11.1978 that the Receiver has taken possession of the Nalban Fishery was a symbolic one inasmuch as the State of West\tFacts\nBengal was in fact in possession of the said fishery\tFacts\nThe Receiver,therefore,intimated to the Registrar of this Court the mistake committed by him in his earlier report and after taking advice from the Senior Counsel expressed apology to this Court for the mistake committed in the earlier report While the matter stood thus in relation to the aforesaid Nalban Fishery,the Government of West Bengal handed over the possession of the said Nalban Fishery to the Director of Inland Fisheries,State Fisheries Development Corporation for undertaking fisheries development scheme\tFacts\nThe aforesaid Corporation issued an advertisement for auctioning the Nalban Fishery for a Boating Complex\tFacts\nThe Sarkar family thereupon filed an application before the Calcutta High Court contending inter alia that under the decree passed in the partition suit by the Supreme Court the property belongs to the Sarkar family and could not have been handed-over to the State of West Bengal,That application was disposed of by the learned Single called upon the Collector 24 Parganas who was the Receiver pursuance to the orders of the Supreme Court to take over the possession of Nalban Fishery from the State of West Bengal and give vacant possession of the same to the Sarkar family\tFacts\nThis order of the learned Single Judge was challenged in appeal before the Division Bench and the Division Bench having dismissed the same,the present appeals have been preferred\tFacts\nIt may be noticed at this stage that Bansilal Farms,appellant in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.13314 of 1992 was the highest offerer for running the Boating Complex on the surface water of Nalban Fishery and had been granted licence for that purpose and in fact had started the operation of the Boating Complex since 1991 but on the application of Mrs\tFacts\nDhira Mitra one of the Co-sharers of the Sarkar family,the High Court having issued an order of injunction,the farm is no longer operating\tFacts\nMr\tArgument\nHarish Salve,the learned Senior Counsel for the State of West Bengal\tArgument\nS.S.Ray,the learned Senior Counsel appearing for Bansilal Farms and Mr\tArgument\nG.Ramaswamy,the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State Fishery Development Corporation Ltd.contended that a compromise decree between the parties in a suit for partition will not in army way affect the rights of the State in respect of the fisheries whether such rights the State acquires by virtue of an order of requisition under the Requisition Act or by virtue of any other statutory provisions under which the fisheries right vest in the State\tArgument\nIt was further contended that this Court while giving affect to the compromise arrived at between the Sarkar family made it explicitely clear that the said compromise will not in any way affect the rights of the State over the fisheries even if those fisheries agreed to be divided between the parties and in that view of the matter and the State of West Bengal having already requisitioned the Nalban Fishery and having taken possession of the same the Receiver could not have taken possession of the said Nalban Fishery pursuant to the order of this Court appointing the Collector 24 Parganas as Receiver and\tArgument\nunder the circumstances the said Receiver rightly intimated this Court about the mistake committed by him and re-delivered possession of Nalban fishery to the State of West Bengal\tArgument\nThe Calcutta High Court,both the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench committed serious error of law in directing the Receiver to take possession of Nalban fishery from the State of West Bengal and deliver-the vacant possession of the same to the members of the Sarkar family\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel also urged that in any view of the matter,on the amendment of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act in the year 1936 giving it retrospective effect and defining land to include tank -fishery the Nalban Fishery vests in the State of West Bengal and,therefore,the High Court could not have issued the impugned direction\tArgument\nRay the learned senior counsel appearing for Bansilal Farms in addition to the contentions raised by Mr\tArgument\nSalve appearing for the State of West\tArgument\nBengal contended that the State being the owner of Nalban Fishery and having vested the management and control thereof with the State Fishery Development Corporation and the said Corporation having decided to use the tank fishery for a Boating Complex and the Bansilal Farms being the highest bidder and having been granted the right to have a Boating Complex therein and he having invested a huge sum of money,his rights cannot be taken away in the dispute between the State and the Sarkar family\tArgument\nJaideep Gupta,learned counsel appearing for the respondents on the other hand condented that the decree passed by the Supreme Court in the partition suit amongst the members of the Sarkar family on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties would bind the State of West Bengal as the decree has been passed in presence of the State who was impleaded as a party\tArgument\nHe further contended that Nalban Fishery having been vested in the State of West Bengal under the provisions of West Bengal under the provisions of West Bengal Acquisition Act,1955,the State cannot get rid of the direction given by the Supreme Court to the Receiver to handover possession of the various fisheries covered by the final decree to the parties to whom they have been allotted under the decree and the Nalban Fishery being one such fishery,the possession thereof was required to be given to the person in whose favour the said fishery has been allotted and therefore the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench in appeal have rightly issued the directions\tArgument\nGupta also contended that the Receiver assumed possession of the fisheries pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court dated 6th of November,1978 and having submitted a report to that effect on 22.11.1978 indicating that it has taken possession of the Nalban Fishery\tArgument\nThe subsequent incumbent to the post of District Magistrate 24 Parganas,who became the Receiver by virtue of his official position had no further jurisdiction to re-deliver possession of the Nalban Fishery to the State of West Bengal and the comments already made by the High Court on the report of the subsequent Receiver sufficiently indicate how he had acted with the bias mind and consequently the Nalban Fishery having not vested in the State of West Bengal under the Acquisition Act,the decree passed by the Supreme Court on 18.4.1979 remains operative\tRatio of the decision\nJudged from this view there is no infirmity with the direction issued by the learned Single Judge as well as Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court warranting interference by this Court\tRatio of the decision\nGupta,also contended that the order of the High Court of Hon'ble Mr\tArgument\nJustice Deepak Kumar Sen dated 23.9.1980 directing the Receiver to allow M/s\tArgument\nGhose and Saha Surveyors to make proper demarcation in the Nalban Fishery dividing the same in two lots and thereafter carry out the directions of the Supreme Court in respect thereof has become final,the same not having been challenged by the State of West\tArgument\nBengal and therefore,it would not be open for the said State in application for execution of the decree to raise the question of vesting of the Nalban Fishery with the State and the Court would not interfere with the direction given by the learned single Judge and Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court\tArgument\nOn the question of vesting of the tank fishery under the amended provisions of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act,Mr\tArgument\nGupta contended that the validity of the said Act has been challenged and is pending before the Calcutta High Court,an interim order has been passed in the said proceeding and therefore until that matter is decided it cannot be said\tArgument\nthat the tank fishery vested with the State of West Bengal\tArgument\nIn this connection,he had further urged that this question had not been raised before the High Court\tArgument\nIn view of the rival submissions at the Bar the first question that arises for consideration is whether in the suit for partition amongst the members of the Sarkar family which was ultimately disposed of by a compromise decree in this Court Nalban Fishery had been allotted to some members of the Sarkar family and whether such decree would affect the rights of the State and bind the State of West\tRatio of the decision\nBengal\tRatio of the decision\nThe Nalban Fishery was one of the items of property in the suit for partition is not disputed\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not disputed that the State of West Bengal though was not a party to the suit but in course of proceeding before this Court by an order of the Court the said State of West Bengal was impleaded as a party\tRatio of the decision\nThe aforesaid order directing impleadment of the State of West Bengal as a 7 party was obviously intended for the purpose that the interest of the State and the rights of the State in relation of the State and the rights of the State in relation of the State and the rights of the State in relation to several fisheries could be protected\tRatio of the decision\nThe suit ultimately no doubt was disposed of on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties but the court took sufficient care in disposing of the appeals on the terms of compromise by observing that the State has substantial interest with regard to fisheries rights covered by the litigation and nothing in the decree will not affect the rights of the State of West\tStatute\nBengal in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question if they are vested in the State under the provisions of West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act,1953\tStatute\nIt would be appropriate at this stage to extract this part of the decree passed by this Court: \"In view of the foregoing,we again wish to re-emphasize that the terms the decree shall not affect the rights of the State of West Bengal,in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question,if they have vested in the state under the provisions of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act,1953 (Act X of 1954\tRuling by Lower Court\nFurther while directing the Receiver to handover possession of the various fisheries covered by the final decree to the parties to whom they have been allotted under the decree,this Court also protected the interest of the State by observing: \"We made it quite clear that this will not in any manner prejudice or affect the right of the State to its claim over the fisheries under the West Bengal Acquisition Act 1955 (West Bengal Act 1 of 1954) or under any other statute\tRatio of the decision\nIt is an undisputed fact that Nalban Fishery had been requisitioned much prior to the aforesaid decree of this court dated 18.4.1979 and,therefore,the rights of the State to the fishery either by virtue of the requisition order or by virtue of any provision of any other statute remained protected and as such said State of West\tRatio of the decision\nBengal can't be bound down by the so-called allotment of fisheries in favour of some members of the Sarkar family under the compromise decree in question\tRatio of the decision\nThe Nalban Fishery had been requisitioned by the State of West Bengal in exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the West Bengal Land Requisition and Acquisition Act is not disputed and cannot be disputed and since the validity of the said order of requisition had been challenged by the Sarkar family in the Calcutta High Court and being unsuccessful there,they had also filed special leave petition in this Court in SLP (C\tStatute\nNo.1452/72 which was ultimately dismissed by this Court on 17.11.1972\tStatute\nThe dismissal of the special leave petition as aforesaid affirmed that the Nalban Fishery had been legally requisitioned by the State of West Bengal and the State was in possession of the same since 8.11.1969\tRatio of the decision\nThe next question that arises for consideration is whether the Receiver appointed by this Court was at all entitled to take possession of the Nalban Fishery pursuant to the Order of this Court or the Nalban Fishery could not have been taken possession by the Receiver and,therefore,the second Receiver rightly corrected the mistake committed by his predecessor\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the report submitted by the Receiver it transpired that the District Magistrate 24 Parganas who was appointed as Receiver took possession of several fisheries including Nalban Fishery Obviously on the impression that the lease in respect of the said fishery which had been granted by the SarKar family had lapsed\tRatio of the decision\nThe said Receiver was not aware of the fact that Nalban Fishery had in fact requisitioned by the State of West Bengal and the State is in possession of the same since November,1369.The possession -thus taken by the Receiver of the vast extent tank fishery is obviously a symbolical possession but in view of the order of this Court dated 18.4.1979 as well as 22.4.1979 while passing a decree in terms of compromise arrived at between the parties and on the admitted position that State had already come into possession of the fishery by virtue of the order under the Requisition Act,the said fishery remained out of the purview of the allotment made by the Sarkar family in the compromise and,therefore,the Receiver could not have taken possession of the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe successor Receiver,in the circumstances,therefore,was fully justified in bringing it to the notice of this Court by giving a second report indicating therein that his predecessor had erroneously taken the possession of Nalban Fishery which is in contravention of the directions of this court dated 18.4.1979 and for which the Receiver offered his unconditional apology\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not find any force in the contention of Mr\tRatio of the decision\nGupta appearing for the respondents that the succeeding Receiver had no jurisdiction to re-deliver the possession of Nalban Fishery is the State of West Bengal when his predecessor has already taken possession of the same pursuant to the order of this Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe receiver appointed by a court is an officer of the court\tRatio of the decision\nThe said receiver will be fully justified in rectifying any mistake or error committed by him while implementing the direction of the court\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not find any illegality in the act of the succeeding Receiver in rectifying the earlier mistake and re-delivering the possession of Nalban Fishery to the State of West Bengal\tRatio of the decision\nAs has been stated earlier the possession which was taken by the earlier Receiver was a symbolical one and factually the State had not been divested of its possession which it took on 8.11.1969.In our considered opinion the succeeding Receiver rightly took into account the directions of this Court passed on 18.4.1979 and 24.4.1979 and rightly took the view that the rights and interest of the State in relation to Nalban Fishery is not affected in any manner by the so-called allotment of the fishery in the partition decree amongst the members of the Sarkar family\tRatio of the decision\nThe next question that arises for consideration is whether the order of Hon'ble Mr\tRatio of the decision\nJustice Deepak Kumar Sen dated 6.10.1980 would operate as res judicata since the State did not challenge the same\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the order in question which has been annexed as Annexure P to the Special Leave Petition (C) No.13314 of 1992,it appears that the order was passed on the application on one of the members of Sarkar family Mr\tRatio of the decision\nPulak Sarkar\tRatio of the decision\nThe State of West Bengal was neither a party to the proceedings nor was noticed by the High Court before passing the order\tRatio of the decision\nThe order was in fact a direction to the Collector 24 Paraganas who had been appointed as a Receiver by the Supreme Court in the pending appeal before it\tRatio of the decision\nNo reasons have been given by the learned Judge in issuing the said directing and on the other hand the order appears to be bald order calling upon and,thereafter,carry out the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in respect of the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe aforesaid order cannot be held to operate as res judicata taking away the rights of the State of West\tRatio of the decision\nBengal in respect of the Nalban Fishery as the State was not a party to the proceedings\tRatio of the decision\nBesides the direction of the learned Judge to the effect: \"The collector,24 Paraganas,is directed to allow Messers Ghose and Saha Surveyors to make proper demarcation in the Nalban Fishery dividing the same in two lots\tRatio of the decision\nAfter such demarcation is made the Commissioner of Partition is directed to approve the same and carry out the direction of the Honble Supreme Court in respect thereof.\" does not in any way take away rights of the State of West\tRatio of the decision\nBengal which is otherwise protected by the Supreme Court while passing the compromise decree\tRatio of the decision\nThe direction of the learned Single Judge on the other hand is to carry out the directions of the Supreme Court in respect of the Nalban Fishery\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of our earlier conclusion that the rights and interest of the State of West Bengal was not in any way be affected by the so-called partition and allotment of the Nalban Fishery inter se amongst the members of the Sarkar family,the said order dated 63.10.1980 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court will not stand on the way of the State in claiming and putting forth its interest and right over the Nalban Fishery\tRatio of the decision\nThe contention of Mr\tRatio of the decision\nGupta appearing for the respondents,therefore,cannot be sustained\tRatio of the decision\nThe next question that arises for consideration is what is the effect of the amendment to the West Bengal Land Reforms Act which was amended in the year 1986 but with retrospective effect\tRatio of the decision\nBy virtue of the extended definition of 'land' in Section 2 (7) and the amended provisions of Section 3(A) of the Land Reforms Act,tank fishery,like Nalban Fishery come within the definition of and it vests in the State by operation of Section 3(1) read with Section 14\tStatute\nIt is no doubt true that a writ petition has been filed challenging the validity of the aforesaid Act and Notification issued there under in relation to vary Nalban Fishery,which is still pending and,therefore,it would not be proper for us to examine the provisions of the emended West Bengal Land Reforms Act and to express any opinion thereon\tRatio of the decision\nSuffice it to say that under the amended provisions of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act tank fishery being included in the land would vest in the State by combined reading of Sections 3A and 14 and,therefore,the State cannot be divested of the rights accruing by the amended provisions until the amended provisions are declared invalid by a competent court of law\tRatio of the decision\nSince we have been informed that the writ petition challenging the amended Act is still pending in the Calcutta High Court we may observe that our conclusion hereunder in relation to applicability of the amended provisions of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act,so far as Nalban Fishery is concerned,would be subject to the constitutionality itself to be decided by the High Court in the pending writ petition\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of our aforesaid conclusions,the impugned directions of the learned Single Judge as well as of the Division Bench are set aside and these appeals are allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nThe injunction order issued against Bansilal Farms,appellant in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.13314 of 1992,stands vacated\tRuling by Present Court\nWe would further observe that the State should determine the amount of compensation which the Sarkar family is entitled to under the relevant provisions of the Act under which Nalban Fishery vests with the State of West Bengal and the compensation amount be paid on being determined in accordance with the law to the family members of Sarkar family in whose favour Nalban Fishery had been allotted under the compromise decree by this Court\tRuling by Present Court\nThere will be no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nOrder Accordingly\tRuling by Present Court\n"

away\tFacts\nThe police investigated into the said complaint and submitted a report u/s.173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'the Code\tFacts\nOn that basis,the following charge was framed by the Judicial Magistrate,First Class,Karnal,against the appellant - \"That on 23.3.1996,after having made preparation for causing hurt or assault,you committed house trespass into the house of Smt\tFacts\nPrakashi Devi,and thereby committed an offence punishable u/s.452 IPC within my cognizance\tFacts\nSecondly on the same date,time and place,you assaulted and used criminal force against abovenamed Prakashi Devi with intent to outrage her modesty and thereby committed an offence punishable u/s.354 IPC and within my cognizance\tFacts\nAnd I hereby direct that you be tried on the above said charge by this court\tFacts\nEmphasis supplied\tFacts\nWhen the said charged was read over and explained to the appellant,he pleaded not guilty to the said charge and claimed trial\tFacts\nPrakashi Devi was examined as PW-1.She reiterated what was recorded in the FIR,that the appellant came into the house around 11.30 PM and broke the bulbs,that he came again around 00.30 AM and touched her daughter-in-law (Sheela Devi) and when her daughter-in-law woke up and raised an alarm,the appellant ran away\tFacts\nIn her cross-examination,Prakashi Devi stated that she has five sons; that only her husband and one son named Mahavir were staying with her; that the other four sons were married and were not staying with her; that on that night,her husband was away in the fields and her son Mahavir was also not present in the house\tFacts\nHowever,when confronted with her statement recorded in the FIR,she admitted having stated that when the appellant had come first time at around 11.30 PM and broke the outside bulbs,her son woke up and went out of the house\tFacts\nShe also admitted that the appellant did not touch her nor teased her nor abused her\tFacts\nHer daughter-in-law Sheela Devi gave evidence as PW-2 and stated that she was married to one Jaibir who worked in the military services; that at 11 to 11.30 PM the accused scaled the door and broke the bulbs in the verandah of her house; that when she identified the accused and raised an alarm the accused ran away; that again he came around 00.30 AM by scaling the door and caught her hand; and that when she raised an alarm and when her mother-in-law woke up,he ran away\tFacts\nIt was elicited in her cross-examination that the accused did not go towards her mother-in-law nor say anything to her mother-in-law; that she used to come to the village where her in-laws were residing,only when her husband came home; and that the house of her father-in-law was surrounded by the houses of his brothers and their sons\tFacts\nBoth PW1 and PW2 stated that the house of the accused was at a distance of 15-16 houses from the house of Prakashi Devi; that the accused had never come into their house earlier; that their family and the accused were not on visiting terms with each other even during functions,marriages or death,though they were on visiting terms with others in the village\tFacts\nPW 2 also stated that she did not know the particulars of the dispute between the accused and her in-laws\tFacts\nThe investigating officer was examined as PW-3.The accused examined a witness Ex-Sarpanch of the village as DW-1 and he stated that there was a quarrel between the accused and complainant's son Surinder about a water course and subsequently he came to know that the quarrel was converted into a false case against the accused by registering a false allegation that the accused had outraged the modesty of a woman\tFacts\nThe learned Magistrate by judgment dated 2.2.2001,held the accused guilty of offences u/ss.452 and 354 Cr\tRuling by Lower Court\nPC and sentenced him for rigorous imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs.1,000/-in default thereof simple imprisonment for one month\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe appeal filed by the accused was dismissed by the Addl\tRuling by Lower Court\nSessions Judge on 20.2.2002.The criminal revision filed by the appellant was disposed of by the High Court on 16.3.2010 upholding the conviction but reducing the sentence from six to four months rigorous imprisonment\tRuling by Lower Court\nThat order is challenged by the accused\tFacts\nOne of the contentions urged by the accused before the appellate court and High Court was that the charge against him was that he attempted to outrage the modesty of Prakashi Devi (PW-1) whereas the evidence was to show that he attempted to outrage the modesty of her daughter-in-law Sheela Devi\tFacts\nHe contended that as the charge levelled against him was not proved,and as he was not required to defend himself against a charge that he assaulted and outraged the modesty of Sheela Devi,he ought to have been acquitted\tFacts\nThis was negatived by the appellate court and High Court holding that an accused cannot take advantage of a technical defect in framing the charge\tFacts\nIt was held that mentioning the name of Prakashi Devi instead of the name of Sheela Devi in the charge was an error that did not prejudice the accused\tFacts\nThe following question therefore arises for our consideration: When the charge is that the accused assaulted 'X' and outraged her modesty,but the evidence is that he assaulted 'Y' to outrage her modesty,can the accused be punished,for having assaulting and outraging the modesty of 'Y',even though he was not charged with any offence with reference to 'Y',on the ground that the error or omission in the charge did not prejudice the accused or result in failure of justice\tRatio of the decision\nS.211 of the Code relates to the contents of the charge\tStatute\nIt inter alia provides that every charge under the Code shall state the offence with which the accused is charged\tStatute\nS.212 of the Code provides that the charge shall contain the particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence,and the person (if any) against whom,or the thing (if any) in respect of which,it was committed,as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged\tStatute\nS.215 of the Code however clarifies that no error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge,and no omission to state the offence or those particulars,shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material,unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission,and it has occasioned a failure of justice\tStatute\nS.464 of the Code relates to effect of omission to frame,or absence of,or error in,charge\tStatute\nSub-s.(1) thereof provides that no finding,sentence or order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the ground of any error,omission or irregularity in the charge including any misjoinder of charge,unless,in the opinion of the court of appeal,confirmation or revision,a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby\tStatute\nSub-s.(2) of sec.464 provides that if the court of appeal,confirmation or revision is of opinion that failure of justice has in fact been occasioned,it may -- (a) in the case of an omission to frame a charge,order that a charge be framed and that the trial be recommended from the point immediately after the framing of the charge; (b) in case of an error,omission or irregularity in the charge,direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit\tStatute\nIn Willie (William) Slaney vs\tPrecedent\nState of Madhya Pradesh\tPrecedent\nAIR 1956 SC 116 1955 Indlaw SC 80] this court explained the concepts of \"prejudice to the accused\" and \"failure of justice\" thus:- \"(6) Before we proceed to set out our answer and examine the provisions of the Code,we will pause to observe that the Code is a code of procedure and,like all procedural laws,is designed to further the ends of justice and not to frustrate them by the introduction of endless technicalities\tPrecedent\nThe object of the Code is to ensure that an accused person gets a full and fair trial along certain well-established and well-understood lines that accord with our notions of natural justice\tPrecedent\nIf he does,if he is tried by a competent court,if he is told and clearly understands the nature of the offence for which he is being tried,if the case against him is fully and fairly explained to him and he is afforded a full and fair opportunity of defending himself,then,provided there is 'substantial' compliance with the outward forms of the law,mere mistakes in procedure,mere inconsequential errors and omissions in the trial are regarded as venal by the Code and the trial is not vitiated unless the accused can show substantial prejudice\tPrecedent\nThat,broadly speaking,is the basic principle on which the Code is based\tPrecedent\nNow here,as in all procedural laws,certain things are regarded as vital\tPrecedent\nDisregard of a provision of that nature is fatal to the trial and at once invalidates the conviction\tPrecedent\nOthers are not vital and whatever the irregularity they can be cured; and in that event the conviction must stand unless the Court is satisfied that there was prejudice\tPrecedent\nSome of these matters are dealt with by the Code and wherever that is the case full effect must be given to its provisions\tPrecedent\nThis Court then examined the question as to when a procedure adopted could be said to have worked actual injustice to the accused and held : \"Except where there is something so vital as to cut at the root of jurisdiction or so abhorrent to what one might term natural justice,the matter resolves itself to a question of prejudice\tRuling by Lower Court\nSome violations of the Code will be so obvious that they will speak for themselves as,for example,a refusal to give the accused a hearing,a refusal to allow him to defend himself,a refusal to explain the nature of the charge to him and so forth\tRuling by Lower Court\nThese go to the foundations of natural justice and would be struck down as illegal forthwith\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt hardly matters whether this is because prejudice is then patent or because it is so abhorrent to well-established notions of natural justice that a trial of that kind is only a mockery of a trial and not of the kind envisaged by the laws of our land because either way they would be struck down at once\tRuling by Lower Court\nOther violations will not be so obvious and it may be possible to show that having regard to all that occurred no prejudice was occasioned or that there was no reasonable probability of prejudice\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn still another class of case,the matter may be so near the border line that very slight evidence of a reasonable possibility of prejudice would swing the balance in favour of the accused\tRuling by Lower Court\nthe Code is emphatic that 'whatever' the irregularity it is not to be regarded as fatal unless there is prejudice\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt is the substance that we must seek\tRuling by Lower Court\nCourts have to administer justice and justice includes the punishment of guilt just as much as the protection of innocence\tRuling by Lower Court\nNeither can be done if the shadow is mistaken for the substance and the goal is lost in a labyrinth of unsubstantial technicalities\tRuling by Lower Court\nBroad vision is required,a nice balancing of the rights of the State and the protection of society in general against protection from harassment to the individual and the risks of unjust conviction\tRuling by Lower Court\nEvery reasonable presumption must be made in favour of an accused person; he must be given the benefit of every reasonable doubt\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe same broad principles of justice and fair play must be brought to bear when determining a matter of prejudice as in adjudging guilt\tRuling by Lower Court\nBut when all is said and done what we are concerned to see is whether the accused had a fair trial,whether he knew what he was being tried for,whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself\tRuling by Lower Court\nIf all these elements are there and no prejudice is shown the conviction must stand whatever the irregularities whether traceable to the charge or to a want of one\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn adjudging the question of prejudice the fact that the absence of a charge,or a substantial mistake in it,is a serious lacuna will naturally operate to the benefit of the accused and if there is any reasonable and substantial doubt about whether he was,or was reasonably likely to have been,misled in the circumstances of any particular case,he is as much entitled to the benefit of it here as elsewhere; but if,on a careful consideration of all the facts,prejudice,or a reasonable and substantial likelihood of it,is not disclosed the conviction must stand; also it will always be material to consider whether objection to the nature of the charge,or a total want of one,was taken at an early stage\tRuling by Lower Court\nBut these are matters of fact which will be special to each different case and no conclusion on these questions of fact in any one case can ever be regarded as a precedent or a guide for a conclusion of fact in another,because the facts can never be alike in any two cases however alike they may seem\tRuling by Lower Court\nThere is no such thing as a judicial precedent on facts though counsel,and even judges,are sometimes prone to argue and to act as if there were\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn Gurbachan Singh v\tPrecedent\nState of Punjab [AIR 1957 SC 623 1957 Indlaw SC 181] following Willie Slaney,this Court held: \"In judging a question of prejudice,as of guilt,courts must act with a broad vision and look to the substance and not to technicalities,and their main concern should be to see whether the accused had a fair trial,whether he knew what he was being tried for,whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself\tPrecedent\nIn Shamnsaheb M.Multtani vs\tPrecedent\nState of Karnataka -2001\tPrecedent\n2) SCC 577\tPrecedent\n2001 Indlaw SC 19904,this Court considered the meaning of the expression \"failure of justice\" occurring in s.464 of Cr\tPrecedent\nPC.This Court held thus : \"The crux of the matter is this : Would there be occasion for a failure of justice by adopting such a course as to convict an accused of the offence under section 304-B IPC when all the ingredients necessary for the said offence have come out in evidence,although he was not charged with the said offence\tPrecedent\na conviction would be valid even if there is any omission or irregularity in the charge,provided it did not occasion a failure of justice\tPrecedent\nThe criminal court,particularly the superior court should make a close examination to ascertain whether there was really a failure of justice or whether it is only a camouflage\tPrecedent\nOne of the cardinal principles of natural justice is that no man should be condemned without being heard,(audi alteram partem).But the law reports are replete with instances of courts hesitating to approve the contention that failure of justice had occasioned merely because a person was not heard on a particular aspect\tPrecedent\nHowever,if the aspect is of such a nature that non-explanation of it has contributed to penalizing an individual,the court should say that since he was not given the opportunity to explain that aspect there was failure of justice on account of non-compliance with the principle of natural justice\tPrecedent\nThe above principles are reiterated in several decisions of this Court,including State of West Bengal vs\tPrecedent\nLaisal Haque -AIR 1989 SC 129 1988 Indlaw SC 706,State of A.P.vs\tPrecedent\nThakkidiram Reddy\tPrecedent\n6) SCC 554 1998 Indlaw SC 1286,Dalbir Singh v\tPrecedent\nState of UP [2004 (5) SCC 334 2004 Indlaw SC 247],Dumpala Chandra Reddy vs\tPrecedent\nNimakayala Bali Reddy -2008\tPrecedent\n8) SCC 339 2008 Indlaw SC 1064 and Sanichar Sahni vs\tPrecedent\nState of Bihar -2009 (7) SCC 198 2009 Indlaw SC 736\tPrecedent\nThe following principles relating to sections 212,215 and 464 of the Code,relevant to this case,become evident from the said enunciations: (i\tRatio of the decision\nThe object of framing a charge is to enable an accused to have a clear idea of what he is being tried for and of the essential facts that he has to meet\tRatio of the decision\nThe charge must also contain the particulars of date,time,place and person against whom the offence was committed,as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged\tRatio of the decision\nii\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused is entitled to know with certainty and accuracy,the exact nature of the charge against him,and unless he has such knowledge,his defence will be prejudiced\tRatio of the decision\nWhere an accused is charged with having committed offence against one person but on the evidence led,he is convicted for committing offence against another person,without a charge being framed in respect of it,the accused will be prejudiced,resulting in a failure of justice\tRatio of the decision\nBut there will be no prejudice or failure of justice where there was an error in the charge and the accused was aware of the error\tRatio of the decision\nSuch knowledge can be inferred from the defence,that is,if the defence of the accused showed that he was defending himself against the real and actual charge and not the erroneous charge\tRatio of the decision\niii\tRatio of the decision\nIn judging a question of prejudice,as of guilt,the courts must act with a broad vision and look to the substance and not to the technicalities,and their main concern should be to see whether the accused had a fair trial,whether he knew what he was being tried for,whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly,and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent relied upon the decision of this court in State of Himachal Pradesh v\tPrecedent\nGeeta Ram [2000 (7) SCC 452 2000 Indlaw SC 408].In that case\tPrecedent\nthe respondent was chargesheeted for an offence u/s.376 IPC and s.3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities\tPrecedent\nAct,1989.The Magistrate committed the case to Sessions Court which was specified as a special court under the Act\tPrecedent\nThe special court framed a charge only for an offence u/s.376 IPC and after trial convicted the respondent u/s.376 IPC and sentenced him to ten years imprisonment\tPrecedent\nThe High Court set aside the conviction on the technical ground that the trial court had no jurisdiction as it was a special court specified in under the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\tPrecedent\nThis Court reversed the decision of the High Court on the ground that a special court under the Act being a sessions court,it continued to have jurisdiction to try the case for the offence u/s.376\tPrecedent\nIPC.That matter was considered u/s.465 of the Code and not relevant on the facts of this case\tPrecedent\nAs noticed above,in this case,the charge was that appellant committed trespass into the house of Prakashi Devi for assaulting Prakashi Devi,and assaulted the said Prakashi Devi and outraged her modesty\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused concentrated his cross-examination with reference to the said charge and elicited answers showing that he did not assault or outrage the modesty of Prakashi Devi\tRatio of the decision\nHe did not try to challenge the evidence let in to show that he had tried to outrage the modesty of Sheela Devi,as he was not charged with such an offence\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 was that the appellant did not touch or tease or abuse Prakashi Devi\tRatio of the decision\nTheir evidence was that he touched/caught the hand of Sheela Devi and when she raised an alarm he ran away\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the charge was that the accused attempted to commit trespass into the house of Prakashi Devi with intent to outrage the modesty of Prakashi Devi,the conclusion of the appellate court and the High Court that there was no failure of justice if he is punished for the offence of having assaulted Sheela Devi and outraging her modesty,is opposed to principles of fair play and natural justice embodied in sections 211,212,215 and 464 of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the accused is charged with having entered the house of Prakashi Devi and assaulted the said Prakashi Devi with intent to outrage her modesty and when the accused defended himself in regard to the said charge and concentrated on proving that the said charges were not true,he cannot be convicted for having assaulted and outraging the modesty of someone else,namely Sheela Devi\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused did not have any opportunity to meet or defend himself against the charge that he assaulted Sheela Devi and outraged her modesty\tRatio of the decision\nNor did he proceed with his defence on the understanding that he was being charged with having committed the offence with reference to Sheela Devi\tRatio of the decision\nOne of the fundamental principles of justice is that an accused should know what is the charge against him so that he can build his defence in regard to that charge\tRatio of the decision\nAn accused cannot be punished for committing an offence against 'Y' when he is charged with having committed the offence against 'X' and the entire defence of the accused was with reference to charge of having committed offence against 'X\tRatio of the decision\nThe illustrations under a provision of a Statute offer relevant and valuable indications as to meaning and object of the provision and are helpful in the working and application of the provision\tStatute\nIllustration (e) u/s.215 of the Code,as contrasted from illustration (d) under that section,throws some light on this issue\tStatute\nThe said illustrations are extracted below : \"(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January,1882.In fact,the murdered person's name was Haidar Baksh,and the date of the murder was the 20th\tStatute\nJanuary,1882.A was never charged with any murder but one,and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate,which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh\tStatute\nThe Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled,and that the error in the charge was immaterial\tStatute\ne) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January,1882,and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21 st January,1882.When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh,he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh\tStatute\nThe witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh\tStatute\nThe Court may infer from this that A was misled,and that the error was material\tStatute\nApplying the guidance offered by the said illustrations and the legal principles evolved by this Court,the position will be as follows\tRatio of the decision\nIf Sheela Devi alone had been present at the house at the time of the incident and the accused had assaulted and outraged the modesty of the said Sheela Devi,but in the charge the name of the victim had been erroneously mentioned,say as Sushila Devi or Prakashi Devi (though there was no person by such name),and the inquiry exclusively referred to the assault and outraging the modesty of Sheela Devi,the court could infer that the accused was not misled and the error in the charge was immaterial\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other hand,if two persons were present in the house at the time of the incident namely Prakashi Devi and Sheela Devi and the accused is charged with trespassing into the house of Prakashi Devi,and assaulting and outraging the modesty of the said Prakashi Devi,and the witnesses refer only to the assault and outraging the modesty of Sheela Devi,the court will have to infer that the accused was prejudiced,if the accused had solely concentrated and focused his defence and entire cross-examination to show that he did not commit the offences against Prakashi Devi\tRatio of the decision\nThe court having charged the accused with the offence of having trespassed into the house of Prakashi Devi with intent to assault her and having further charged him for having assaulted the said Prakashi Devi by outraging her modesty,convicts him on the ground that though he did not assault or outrage the modesty of Prakashi Devi,he had outraged the modesty of Sheela Devi,that would lead to failure of justice\tRatio of the decision\nThere was a material error in the charge as it violated the requirement of sub-s.(1) of s.212 of the Code,that the charge shall contain particulars as to the person against whom the offence was committed\tRatio of the decision\nThere were two women present at the house at the time of the alleged incident,namely Prakashi Devi and her daughter-in-law Sheela Devi\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of the specific charge,the accused concentrated on showing that the charge was false\tRatio of the decision\nHe did not attempt to meet the case made out in the trial that the offence was against Sheela Devi\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused was thus clearly misled by the error in the charge which caused prejudiced to the accused thereby occasioning failure of justice\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,we are of the view that there should be a new trial after charging him with the offence of outraging the modesty of Sheela Devi\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal is therefore allowed,the conviction of the accused is set aside and the matter is remitted to the trial court with a direction for a new trial after framing a charge by substituting the words \"her daughter-in-law Sheela Devi\" for the words \"abovenamed Prakashi Devi\",in the second part of the charge\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

following arguments: 1.Whether or not the State Government was justified in acquiring the said pieces of fertile agricultural land,when there were alternative sites of unfertile banjar land available\tRatio of the decision\n2.Whether or not the State Government was justified in dispensing with the inquiry which is mandated to be conducted under Section 5A of the Act,especially when one year elapsed between the notifications u/s.4 and the one u/s.6.They further stated that the High Court had erred insofar as it upheld the factum of urgency in the absence of a categorical finding,an enquiry under Section 5A would have been detrimental to public interest\tRatio of the decision\nIt was urged that it was clear from the counter of the respondent that the contemplation of a new prison was under consideration of the State Government for several years\tArgument\nCommittee was formed,matter was discussed at a leisurely pace at various levels and there is no material fact to justify the abridgement of the appellants' right of raising an objection to acquisition and of a hearing under Section 5A of the Act\tArgument\nThis Court finds a lot of substance in the contentions of the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIn connection with land acquisition proceeding whenever the provision of S.17 and its various sub-sections including S.17(4) is used in the name of taking urgent or emergent action and the right of hearing of the land holder under Section 5A is dispensed with,the Court is called upon to consider a few fundamentals in the exercise of such powers\tRatio of the decision\nAdmittedly,the Land Acquisition Act,a pre-Constitutional legislation of colonial vintage is a drastic law,being expropriatory in nature as it confers on the State a power which affects person's property right\tRatio of the decision\nEven though right to property is no longer fundamental and was never a natural right,and is acquired on a concession by the State,it has to be accepted that without right to some property,other rights become illusory\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court is considering these questions,especially,in the context of some recent trends in land acquisition\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court is of the opinion that the concept of public purpose in land acquisition has to be viewed from an angle which is consistent with the concept of a welfare State\tRatio of the decision\nThe concept of public purpose cannot remain static for all time to come\tRatio of the decision\nThe concept,even though sought to be defined u/s.3(f) of the Act,is not capable of any precise definition\tRatio of the decision\nThe said definition,having suffered several amendments,has assumed the character of an inclusive one\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be accepted that in construing public purpose,a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people\tRatio of the decision\nAny attempt by the State to acquire land by promoting a public purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people especially of the common people defeats the very concept of public purpose\tRatio of the decision\nEven though the concept of public purpose was introduced by pre-constitutional legislation,its application must be consistent with the Constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under Fundamental Rights and also the Directive Principles\tRatio of the decision\nIn construing the concept of public purpose,the mandate of Art.13 of the Constitution that any pre-constitutional law cannot in any way take away or abridge rights conferred under Part-III must be kept in mind\tRatio of the decision\nBy judicial interpretation the contents of these Part III rights are constantly expanded\tRatio of the decision\nThe meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of Part-III rights\tRatio of the decision\nThe open-ended nature of our Constitution needs a harmonious reconciliation between various competing principles and the overhanging shadows of socio-economic reality in this country\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the concept of public purpose on this broad horizon must also be read into the provisions of emergency power u/s.17 with the consequential dispensation of right of hearing under Section 5A of the said Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Courts must examine these questions very carefully when little Indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the State\tRatio of the decision\nIf public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition,the Courts,before sanctioning an acquisition,must in exercise of its power of judicial review,focus its attention on the concept of social and economic justice\tRatio of the decision\nWhile examining these questions of public importance,the Courts,especially the Higher Courts,cannot afford to act as mere umpires\tRatio of the decision\nIn this context we reiterate the principle laid down by this Court in Authorised Officer,Thanjavur and another vs\tPrecedent\nS.Naganatha\tPrecedent\nAyyar and others reported in (1979) 3 SCC 466 1979 Indlaw SC 224,wherein this Court held: \"It is true that Judges are constitutional invigilators and statutory interpreters; but they are also responsive and responsible to Part IV of the Constitution being one of the trinity of the nation's appointed instrumentalities in the transformation of the socio-economic order\tPrecedent\nThe judiciary,in its sphere,shares the revolutionary purpose of the Constitutional order,and when called upon to decode social legislation must be animated by a goal-oriented approach\tPrecedent\nThis is part of the dynamics of statutory interpretation in the developing countries so that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those who seek to defeat agrarian justice by cute transactions of many manifestations now so familiar in the country and illustrated by the several cases under appeal\tPrecedent\nThis caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not a mere umpire,as some assume,but an activist catalyst in the Constitutional scheme\tPrecedent\nIn other words public purpose must be viewed through the prism of Constitutional values as stated above\tRatio of the decision\nThe aforesaid principles in our jurisprudence compel this Court to construe any expropriartory legislation like the Land Acquisition Act very strictly\tRatio of the decision\nThe judicial pronouncements on this aspect are numerous,only a few of them may be noted here\tRatio of the decision\nIn DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust vs\tPrecedent\nState of Haryana and Ors.(2003) 5 SCC 622 2003 Indlaw SC 124,this Court construed the statute on Town Planning Law and held \"Expropriatory statute,as is well known,must be strictly construed\tPrecedent\nThe same principle has been reiterated subsequently by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in State of Maharashtra and Anr.vs\tPrecedent\nB.E.Billimoria and Ors.(2003) 7 SCC 336 2003 Indlaw SC 618 in the context of ceiling law\tPrecedent\nThese principles again found support in the decision of this Court in Chairman,Indore Vikas Pradhikaran vs\tPrecedent\nPure Industrial Coke and Chemicals\tPrecedent\nLtd.and Ors.(2007\tPrecedent\n8 SCC 705 2007 Indlaw SC 554,wherein this Court construed the status of a person's right to property after deletion of Art.19(1)(f) from Part III.By referring to various international covenants,namely,the Declaration of Human and Civil Rights,this Court held that even though right to property has ceased to be a fundamental right but it would however be given an express recognition as a legal right and also as a human right\tPrecedent\nWhile discussing the ambit and extent of property right,this Court reiterated that expropriatory legislation must be given strict construction\tPrecedent\nIn the background of the aforesaid discussion,this Court proceeds to examine the scope of a person's right under Section 5A of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nInitially,Section 5A was not there in the Land Acquisition Act,1894 but the same was inserted long ago by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act,1923 vide S.3 of Act 38 of 1923\tRatio of the decision\nThe history behind insertion of Section 5A,in the Act of 1894 seems to be a decision of the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court in J.E.D.Ezra vs\tPrecedent\nThe Secretary of State for India and ors reported in 7 C.W.N.249.In that case,the properties of Ezra were sought to be acquired under the pre amended provision of the Act for expansion of the offices of the Bank of Bengal\tPrecedent\nIn challenging the said acquisition,it was argued that the person whose property is going to be taken away should be allowed a hearing on the principles of natural justice\tPrecedent\nHowever the judges found that there was no such provision in the Act\tPrecedent\nIn order to remedy this shortcoming in the Act of 1894,an amendment by way of incorporation of Section 5A was introduced on 11th July,1923.The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the said Amendment is as follows: \"The Land Acquisition Act I of 1894 does not provide that persons having an interest in land which it is proposed to acquire,shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition; nor is Government bound to enquire into and consider any objections that may reach them\tStatute\nThe object of this Bill is to provide that a Local Government shall not declare,u/s.6 of the Act,that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification u/s.4 for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by the Local Government\tStatute\nGazette of India,Pt\tStatute\nV,dated 14th July,1923\tStatute\nThe said amendment was assented to by the Governor General on 5th August,1923 and came into force on 1st January,1924\tStatute\nThe importance and scheme of Section 5A was construed by this Court in several cases\tPrecedent\nAs early as in 1964,this Court in Nandeshwar Prasad and Ors.vs\tPrecedent\nU.P.Government and Ors\tPrecedent\nEtc\tPrecedent\nAIR 1964 SC 1217 1963 Indlaw SC 141 speaking through Justice K.N.Wanchoo (as His Lordship then was\tPrecedent\nheld.\"The right to file objections under Section 5A is a substantial right when a person's property is being threatened with acquisition and we cannot accept that that right can be taken away as if by a side-wind\tPrecedent\nIn that case the Court was considering the importance of rights under Section 5A vis--vis S.17(1) and S.17(1\tPrecedent\nA) of the Act\tPrecedent\nThe same view has been reiterated by another three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Munshi Singh and Ors\tPrecedent\nVs\tPrecedent\nUnion of India (1973) 2 SCC 337 1972 Indlaw SC 176.In Para 17 of the report this Court held that Section 5A embodies a very just and wholesome principle of giving proper and reasonable opportunity to a land loser of persuading the authorities that his property should not be acquired\tPrecedent\nThis Court made it clear that declaration u/s.6 has to be made only after the appropriate Government is satisfied on a consideration of the report made by the Collector under Section 5A.The Court,however,made it clear that only in a case of real urgency the provision of Section 5A can be dispensed with\tPrecedent\nIn Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited vs\tPrecedent\nDarius Shahpur Chennai and ors.,(2005) 7 SCC 627 2005 Indlaw SC 578,this Court held that the right which is conferred under Section 5A has to be read considering the provisions of Article 300-A of the Constitution and,so construed,the right under Section 5A should be interpreted as being akin to a Fundamental Right\tPrecedent\nThis Court held that the same being the legal position,the procedures which have been laid down for depriving a person of the said right must be strictly complied with\tPrecedent\nIn a recent judgment of this Court in Essco Fabs 2008 Indlaw SC 2494 (supra),(2009) 2 SCC 377,this Court,after considering previous judgments as also the provisions of S.17 of the Act held: \"Whereas sub-s.(1) of S.17 deals with cases of \"urgency\",sub-s.(2) of the said section covers cases of \"sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency\".But even in such cases i.e.cases of \"urgency\" or \"unforeseen emergency\",enquiry contemplated by Section 5-A cannot ipso facto be dispensed with which is clear from sub-s.(4) of S.17 of the Act\tPrecedent\nThis Court,therefore,held that once a case is covered under sub-s.(1) or (2) of Section 17,sub-s.(4) of S.17 would not necessarily apply\tPrecedent\nIn our opinion,therefore,the contention of learned counsel for the respondent authorities is not well founded and cannot be upheld that once a case is covered by sub-ss.(1) or (2) of S.17 of the Act,sub-s.(4) of S.17 would necessarily apply and there is no question of holding inquiry or hearing objections under Section 5-A of the Act\tPrecedent\nAcceptance of such contention or upholding of this argument will make sub-s.(4) of S.17 totally otiose,redundant and nugatory\tPrecedent\nThis Court also held that in view of the ratio in Union of India vs\tPrecedent\nMukesh Hans,(2004) 8 SCC 14 2004 Indlaw SC 1413,sub-s.(4) of S.17 cannot be pressed into service by officers who are negligent and lethargic in initiating acquisition proceedings\tPrecedent\nThe question is whether in the admitted facts of this case,invoking the urgency clause u/s.17 (4) is justified\tRatio of the decision\nIn the writ petition before the High Court,the petitioners have given the details of the land holding,and it has also been stated that the entire holding of petitioners 2,5,7,9,10,11 and 13 have been acquired,and as a result of such acquisition,the petitioners have become landless\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the various facts disclosed in the said affidavit it appears that the matter was initiated by the Government's letter dated 4th of June,2008 for issuance of S.4(1) and S.17 notifications\tRatio of the decision\nA meeting for selection of the suitable site for construction was held on 27th June,2008,and the proposal for such acquisition and construction was sent to the Director,Land Acquisition on 2nd of July,2008.This was in turn forwarded to the State Government by the Director on 22nd of July,2008.After due consideration of the forwarded proposal and documents,the State Government issued the S.4 notification,along with S.17 notification on 21st of August,2008.These notifications were published in local newspapers on 24th of September,2008\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter,over a period of 9 months,the State Government deposited 10% of compensation payable to the landowners,along with 10% of acquisition expenses and 70% of cost of acquisition was deposited,and the proposal for issuance of S.6 declaration was sent to the Director,Land Acquisition on 19th of June,2009.The Director in turn forwarded all these to the State Government on 17th July,2009,and the State Government finally issued the S.6 declaration on 10th of August,2009.This declaration was published in the local dailies on 17th of August,2009\tRatio of the decision\nThus the time which elapsed between publication of S.4(1) and S.17 notifications,and S.6 declaration,in the local newspapers is of 11 months and 23 days,i.e.almost one year\tRatio of the decision\nThis slow pace,at which the government machinery had functioned in processing the acquisition,clearly evinces that there was no urgency for acquiring the land so as to warrant invoking S.17 (4) of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nIn paragraph 15 of the writ petition,it has been clearly stated that there was a time gap of more than 11 months between S.4 and S.6 notifications,which demonstrates that there was no urgency in the State action which could deny the petitioners their right under Section 5A.In the counter which was filed in this case by the State before the High Court,it was not disputed that the time gap between S.4 notification read with Section 17,and S.6 notification was about 11 months\tRatio of the decision\nThe construction of jail is certainly in public interest and for such construction land may be acquired\tRatio of the decision\nBut such acquisition can be made only by strictly following the mandate of the said Act\tRatio of the decision\nIn the facts of this case,such acquisition cannot be made by invoking emergency provisions of S.17.If so advised,Government can initiate acquisition proceeding by following the provision of Section 5A of the Act and in accordance with law\tRatio of the decision\nFor the reasons aforesaid,we hold that the State Government was not justified,in the facts of this case,to invoke the emergency provision of S.17(4) of the Act\tRuling by Present Court\nThe valuable right of the appellants under Section 5A of the Act cannot flatten and steamrolled on the 'ipsi dixit' of the executive authority\tRuling by Present Court\nThe impugned notifications u/ss.4 and 6 of the Act in so far as they relate to the appellants' land are quashed\tRuling by Present Court\nThe possession of the appellants in respect of their land cannot be interfered with except in accordance with law\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeals are allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nNo order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

(1927-28 A.D.) in the District Court at Quilon against the respondent to establish his right and title to the said 160 acres and in the adjoining Cherikkal lands in his possession\tFacts\nIn that suit an injunction was prayed for in respect of 100 acres of the property involved in the suit, but the prayer was rejected\tFacts\nAgainst that order a Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No. 206 of 1110 M.E.

Case\tArgument\n112 of 11 00 M. E\tArgument\nand he was evicted in due course, that the trespass by the appellant was of recent origin, that the allegation that the entry was made in the belief that the land belonged to the Illom was false, that the Revenue and Forest Departments did not harass the appellant but they took steps for dispossessing him only in accordance with the law, that the Commissioner's report was not correct in that all the improvements noted by the Commissioner were not made by the appellant but by other independent squatters, that after due notice an order of forfeiture had been passed in L.C. Case\tArgument\n112 of 1100 M.E. and the appellant was therefore not entitled to claim any value for improvements as it was his duty to remove any building before he was evicted\tArgument\nThe respondent also averred that it had not taken possession of any crops or movables as stated in the, plaint and that the movables found in the building were attached for the realisation of arrears of fine etc\tArgument\nThere were other allegations also but it is unnecessary for purposes of this appeal to refer to them\tRatio of the decision\nSeveral issues were framed, but it is not necessary to refer to: them except to say that the suit was decreed only for Rs\tRatio of the decision\n3000/being the value of the appellant's bungalow taken possession of by the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nThe rest of the claim was dismissed\tFacts\nit was observed by the Trial Court that though there is no specific evidence to show when exactly the possession of the appellant had commenced, the evidence however indicated that it must have started close to the year I 100 M. E. and that in any case the claim of the appellant that possession was from 1030 M.E. was not true inasmuch as from the year 1067 M.E. when the Act was passed possession without permission was penal and it could not be imagined that the appellant was left in peace for all these long years\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe Trial Court also held that all through these long years there had been a dispute as to the title between the Illom and the State and after the suit of the Illom was dismissed and the Illom's title was not sustained, the allegation that the improvements were effected cannot be stated to be bona fide\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt pointed out that the plaintiff (appellant) had applied to get himself impleaded on 0.S. No. 126 of 109,6 M. E. but his application was rejected, and after that suit was dismissed the appellant again applied for registry, but that was also rejected\tRuling by Lower Court\nAll this, according to the Trial Court, would show that the appellant was aware that he was remaining on Government lands without title\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt was further held that the greater part of the improvements were affected by the appellant after the proceedings in the L.C. Case No\tRuling by Lower Court\n112 of 1100 M.E. were stayed, as such it cannot be said that these improvements could have been effected in good faith\tRuling by Lower Court\nWith respect to the allegation that an order of forfeiture was not served on the appellant under s. 9 of the .Act, the Court observed that though the State had in its written statement contended that such an order had been passed, no order was produced in evidence and consequently it was conceded by the Government Pleader that no such order was passed\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn the circumstances the question that had to be considered was whether without an order of forfeiture being passed, the respondent could forfeit the improvements\tRuling by Lower Court\nOn this issue it was held that no notice, of forfeiture of trees\tRuling by Lower Court\nneed be given under s. 9 of the Act and, therefore no compensation or damages were payable in respect thereof\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe High Court accepted the finding of the Trial Court on issue\tFacts\nIt observed that the evidence in the case indicated that the possession of the father of the appellant must have commenced close to the year 1100 M.E. and consequently the claim of the appellant that lie was in possession from 1030 M.E. cannot be true\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt then said: \"If the possession commenced only about the year 1100, it certainly cannot be under any bona fide claim of title for even on\tRuling by Lower Court\n12-6-1094, the petitioner knew that the land was Government land and had then applied for assignment of the land\tRuling by Lower Court\nAccordingly the High Court found that at no time the occupation of the land by the appellant was under a bona fide claim of title\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe contention of the appellant that the trees which are the subject-matter of the appeal should have been forfeited by an order passed under s. 9 of the Act and in the absence of such\tFacts\nan order his right to the value of those trees had to be adjudged and paid\tFacts\nto him was also negatived, as the Court held that the words \"any crop or other product raised on the land\" occurring in s. 9 of the Act would not include trees\tFacts\nIn its view these words take in what is familiarly known in law as 'emblements' which according to Black's\tFacts\nLaw Dictionary mean \"Such products of the soil as are annually planted, served and saved by manual labour, as cereals, vegetables, Grass maturing for harvest or harvested, etc., but not grass on lands used for pasturage\tFacts\nIn this view it held that compensation for trees which are to be dealt with under the general law cannot be decreed in favour of a mere trespasser who had no rights therein\tFacts\nIt was also of the view that the claim for compensation for trees which has to be dealt with under the general law under which a mere trespasser would have no rights to the payment of compensation nor could be\tFacts\nAppellant be allowed to remove them after his dispossession\tFacts\nAnother reason for disallowing the compensation for trees given by the High Court was that the position of a trespasser-whether he be a mere trespasser or a trespasser under a bona fide claim of title--cannot be better than that of a tenant, and that if this is correct, then the appeal has to be dismissed on the short ground that there is no principle of law or equity which requires the payment of compensation in respect of trees, the ownership of which was all along, or at any rate from the dale of the trespasser's dispossession, vested in the State\tFacts\nThe learned advocate for the appellant has reiterated the submissions made before the Trial Court and the High Court and contends that there is no order forfeiting the improvements as required under s. 9 of the Act, and if s. 9 does not apply and there is no right of forfeiture as contemplated under s. 9, then the appellant is entitled to compensation under the general law\tArgument\nApart from this contention, towards the end of his argument, the learned advocate for the appellant sought to make out a fresh case, namely, that as the appellant was not served with a notice to quit as required under s. 9 of the Act but was forcibly evicted without giving him an opportunity of cutting and taking away the trees etc\tArgument\nfrom the lands from which he was evicted, he would be entitled to claim compensation for the improvements made by him\tArgument\nIt may be stated that the finding that the possession of the appellant ,commenced after his application for registration was rejected in 1919, and the improvements, if any must have been effected only thereafter with full knowledge that the title to the lands was in dispute between the Illom and the Government, is unassailable\tRatio of the decision\nWe have earlier adverted to Ext\tRatio of the decision\nA and also to the fact that after the application for registration was ,rejected the appellant tried to get himself impleaded in the suit filed by the Illom against the State which application was also rejected and so the claim that his possession was bona fide or that he was a bona fide .trespasser\tRatio of the decision\nhas no validity\tRatio of the decision\nThis finding is fortified by s. 5 of the Act which provides that from and after the commencement of the Act it shall not be lawful for any person to occupy land which is the property of the Government whether Poramboke or not without the permission from the Government or such officer of the Government as may be ,empowered in that behalf\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of this specific provision the contravention of which is punishable under s. 6 thereof, his conduct in applying for registration and for getting himself impleaded in the suit of the Illom against the Government, would show that he knew that the land was Government land or land in which the Government had a claim\tRatio of the decision\nIn these circumstances he cannot be said to be a bona fide trespasser particularly after he had applied to the Government for obtaining .a\tRatio of the decision\nregistration in his name on the basis that it was Government land\tRatio of the decision\nIt is however urged before us that the High Court was in error in thinking that the appellant did not occupy the lands as a trespasser with a bona fide claim of title because it was his case that he trespassed upon the land with a bona fide intention to improve the land, and as such he can still be considered as a bona fide trespasser entitled to improvements under the general law\tArgument\nBefore dealing with this aspect,, we will first consider the question whether trees are included within the meaning of s. 9, so as to entitle the appellant to a notice of forfeiture there under\tStatute\nSection 9 of the Act is in the following terms : \"Any person unauthorised occupying any land for which he is liable to pay a fine under section 6 and an assessment or prohibitory assessment under section 7, may be summarily evicted by the Division Peishkar, and any crop or other product raised on the land shall be liable to forfeiture and any building or other structure erected or anything deposited thereon shall also, if not removed by him after such written notice as the Division Peishkar may deem reasonable, be liable to forfeiture\tStatute\nForfeiture under this section shall be disposed of as the Division Peishkar may direct\tStatute\nAn eviction under this section shall be made in the following manner, namely: By serving a notice on a person reported to be in occupation or his agent, requir ing him, within such time as the Division Peishkar may deem reasonable after receipt of the said notice to vacate the land, and if such notice is not obeyed, by removing or deputing a subordinate to remove any person who may refuse to vacate the same, and, if the officer removing any such person shall be resisted or obstructed by any person, the Division Peishkar shall hold a summary enquiry into the, facts of the case and, if satisfied that the resistance or obstruction still continues, may issue a warrant for the arrest of the said person, and on his appearance may send him with a warrant in the form of the Schedule for imprisonment in the Civil Jail of the District for such period not exceeding 30 days as may be necessary to prevent the continuance of such obstruction or resistance Provided that no person so committed or imprisoned under this section shall be liable to be prosecuted under sections 176, 179 and 181 of the Travancore Penal Code in respect of the same facts\tStatute\nThis section provides for two notices to be given one notice is to be given to the person who is in unauthorised occupation of Government land to vacate the land within a reasonable time and the other notice is to forfeit any crop or other product raised on the land or to remove any building or other structure erected or anything deposited therein within a reasonable time as may be stated in the notice\tRatio of the decision\nIt was conceded before the Trial Court and no attempt was made to establish anything to the contrary before the High Court that no notice of forfeiture as required under s. 9 was given to the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nIn these circumstances, the question that would arise for determination is whether the trees come within the description of \"other product raised on the land\tRatio of the decision\nIt is stated before us that at the time when the appellant was evicted the Transfer of Property Act was not in force\tRatio of the decision\nBut this is not relevant as what has to be considered is whether trees can be said to be \"other product raised on the land\tRatio of the decision\nThe words \"raised on the land\" qualify both the 'crop' and 'other product', so the words \"other product\" have to be read in the context of the word 'crop' which precedes it\tRatio of the decision\nIt was pointed out by the learned advocate that the High Court was in error in equating other product raised on the land with emblements because the definition of crop in Black's Law Dictionary does include emblements, as such the words 'other product' cannot also be treated as emblements and must therefore be given a different meaning which according to him would include trees\tArgument\nNo doubt one of the meanings given in the Black's Law Dictionary does say that in a more restricted sense the word is synonymous with 'fructus industrials\tArgument\nBut the meaning to be ascribed to that word is that it connotes in its larger signification, products of the soil that are grown and raised yearly and are gathered during a single season\tArgument\nIn this sense the term includes \"fructus industrials\" and having regard to the etymology of the word it has been held to mean only products after they have been severed from the soil\tArgument\nThe same dictionary gives the meaning of the word ,,product\" as follows : \"Product with reference to property, proceeds\tArgument\nyield; income; receipts; return\tArgument\nThe \"products\" of a farm may include, the increase of cattle on the premises\tArgument\nEven under this definition \"product\" cannot mean anything which is attached to the land like trees\tRatio of the decision\nIt may, however, include the fruit of the trees\tRatio of the decision\nThis view of ours is supported by the case of Clark and Another v. Gaskarth, 8 Taunt 431\tPrecedent\nThat was a case of a trespass for breaking and entering the closes of the plaintiffs and tearing up, digging up, cutting down, and carrying away the plaintiff's trees, plants, roots and seeds, growing on the closes\tPrecedent\nNotice of this trespass was given to the defendant\tPrecedent\nAt the time of the distress the sum of pound 281.6 s. was due from the plaintiffs to the defendant for rent in respect of the nursery ground\tPrecedent\nThe question before the Court was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover against the defendant damages caused to them by cutting down and carrying away the plaintiffs' trees\tPrecedent\nIt was Contended-that the defendant's action was justified under the statute II G. 2, C. 19, s. 8, which after enumerating certain crops, empowered the landlord to seize as a distress any \"other product whatsoever which shall be growing on any part of the estate demised\" and, therefore, the trees and shrubs in question came within that description\tPrecedent\nThe Court rejected the contention that the trees and shrubs could be detrained and held that the word product' in the eighth section of the statute did not extend to trees and shrubs growing in a nurseryman's ground, but that it was confined to products of a similar nature\tPrecedent\nwith those specified in that section, to all of which the process of becoming ripe, and of being cut, gathered, made, and laid up when ripe, was incidental\tPrecedent\nIn our view, therefore, trees are not included within the meaning of 'other products raised on the, land' in s. 9 of the Act and there is, therefore, no obligation on the Government to give notice of forfeiture under that section\tPrecedent\nIt is then contended that even if trees are not included in s. 9 and no notice of forfeiture is necessary, under the general law even a trespasser on the land, whether bona fide or not, is entitled to compensation or damages for the improvements made by him on the land\tArgument\nWe have already agreed with the Trial Court and the High Court that the appellant was not a bona fide trespasser\tRatio of the decision\nBut the learned advocate for the appellant submits that it was not his case nor is it under the general law necessary for a person who trespassed on the land to trespass with a claim of bona fide title\tArgument\nAccording to his submission a person is nevertheless a bona fide trespasser if he enters upon the land with a bona fide intention of improving the land\tRatio of the decision\nNo authority has been cited for this novel proposition, and if accepted, it would give validity to a dangerous principle which will condone all acts of deliberate and wrongful trespass because any person desparate enough to trespass on other mans' land without any claim of title can always plead that he had a bona fide intention of improving the land whether the owner of that land wants that improvement or not\tRatio of the decision\nThis vicarious and altruistic exhibition of good intention may even cause damage to the land of an owner who may not want improvements of such a kind as tree plantation\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that the maxim of the English law \"quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit\" i.e. whatever is affixed to the soil belongs to the soil, is\tRatio of the decision\nnot applicable in India but that is not to say that a wrongful trespasser can plant trees on someone else's land and claim a right to those trees after he is evicted\tRatio of the decision\nThe case of Vallabdas Narainji v. Development Officer, Bandra, A.I.R. 1929\tPrecedent\nP.C. 163 1929 Indlaw PC 11 which was cited by the learned counsel for the appellant does not assist him, for the Privy Council did not think it necessary to give a decision on what it termed to be a far-reaching contention\tPrecedent\nThat was a case in which the Government had taken possession of the lands and had erected certain building on the land before a decision under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act was made as to the appellant's property arid it was contended that the appellant should be allowed the value of the land in the state in which it then was i.e. with buildings on it\tPrecedent\nIt appears that the Government had resolved to acquire the land in question and other lands and by arrangement with certain of the sutidars it took possession of such land, including a portion which was in the occupation of the appellant\tPrecedent\nUpon such land, including a portion in the possession of the appellant they proceeded to erect buildings without the necessary notification under s. 6 of the Land Acquisition Act which was not served until November 4, 1920\tPrecedent\nOn these findings it was observed that the Government were in a position, by law at any rate, to regularize their possession by such a notification a fact which becomes material when it has to be considered what the nature of the trespass is\tPrecedent\nBoth the Assistant Judge and the High Court negatived the claim of the appellant\tPrecedent\nBefore the Privy Council it was contended on behalf of the appellant that in the various cases relied upon, there was at least some genuine claim or belief in the party erecting the buildings that he had a title to do so, even though he was eventually held to be a trespasser; and it was urged that no such claim or belief existed in that case, in which it was said the Government without any pretence of a right, tortuously invaded the appellant's property and proceeded to deal with it as their own\tPrecedent\nit is in this context that the respondent's contention that even if the appellants were considered to be mere trespassers they would still be entitled to the value of the improvements and contest the claim of the appellant was described, as already stated, as a far-reaching contention\tPrecedent\nThe Board, however, agreed with what was apparently the view of both Courts in India that under the circumstances of this case, as already set forth, by the law of India, which they appear to have correctly interpreted, the Government officials were in possession \"not as mere trespassers\" but under such a colour of title that the buildings erected by them on the land ought not to be included in the valuation as having become the property of the landowner\tPrecedent\nThis case does not support the contention that a mere trespasser who has deliberately and wrongfully contrary to the provisions of s. 5 of the Act, entered 'upon another's land which makes such an act even punishable under s. 6 thereof, is entitled to compensation for the trees planted by him on the land\tRatio of the decision\nIn any case, as the High Court rightly observed, the position of a trespasser cannot be better than that of a lawful tenant who having lost his possession cannot claim compensation or damages for anything erected on the land or any improvements made therein\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant's claim after he was evicted cannot, on the same parity of reasoning, be held to be valid\tRatio of the decision\nOnce the appellant's counsel was confronted I with this proposition, he tried to raise an entirely new point, namely, that no notice of eviction was given to the appellant, and if such a notice had been given to him under s. 9, he would have cut the trees and taken them away, within the time allowed for him to vacate the lands\tRatio of the decision\nIn support of this contention he has referred us to the leadings contained in paragraph-3 of the plaint in which it is stated : \"The improvements effected by the plaintiff have a value of Rs. 2 lakhs as per the accounts shown below\tRatio of the decision\nIn his helplessness the plaintiff had even applied to Government to give him the land in which he had effected improvements, on kuthakapattom\tRatio of the decision\nBut out of the said land 160 acres were taken out of my possession and given to the 2nd defendant even without giving me the opportunity to remove the movable improvements, such as cultivation, cattle, machines, utensils, houses, stocked crops, ripe crops etc., belonging to me\tRatio of the decision\nThese averments in the above paragraph do not clearly allege that he was not evicted without notice, nor has any allegation been made that he was forcibly evicted from the lands with the help of the police etc. as it has now been contended before us\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other hand what the plaintiff (appellant) stated shows that no opportunity was given to him to remove the movable improvements, such as cultivation, cattle, machines, utensils, houses, stocked crops, ripe crops etc. which belonged to him\tRatio of the decision\nThere is nothing stated by him that he had no opportunity to cut trees and take them away\tRatio of the decision\nEven in paragraph-4 of the plaint where he complains that no notice of forfeiture was given to him, he mentions only the items referred to in paragraph-3\tRatio of the decision\nIt is in this connection, he says, that no legal procedure had been followed by Government for taking them into possession, which only implies that it is in respect of the items mentioned in paragraph-3\tRatio of the decision\nIt is again stated in, paragraph-4 that \"It was irregular on the part of Government to take possession of the above items\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent did not understand the averments in the plaint as alleging that no notice to quit was given to him is evident from the written statement of the respondent in paragraph, where it is stated thus\tRatio of the decision\nThis defendant submits that after due notice an order of forfeiture has been passed in Poramboke Case 112 of 11 00 and the plaintiff is therefore not entitled to claim any value of improvements or value of any building\tRatio of the decision\nThe issues that had been famed by the Trial Court also do not refer to this aspect\tRatio of the decision\nNo doubt in the evidence of the plaintiff P.W. 1 states that he was evicted from the lands without giving him an opportunity to remove the improvements, and in cross-examination he was asked whether he was not given any notice prior to the dispossession and he said that certainly no notice was, received\tRatio of the decision\nP.W. 4 the Manager was asked in cross-examination whether he had been given any priorinformation or notice about eviction and this witness also said that there was no prior information or notice\tRatio of the decision\nWhile these passages might show that no notice of eviction was given, even at that stage there was no application for an issue being framed, nor has such an application been made in the appeal before the High Court, nor even before this Court\tRatio of the decision\nin it has been held that the appellant was not a mere trespasser and had deliberately entered upon the lands knowing full well that he had no right, claim or title to the lands or had in any manner a right to enter the land and has been rightly evicted as a trespasser, he cannot now be permitted to raise this contention before us\tRatio of the decision\nIn the view we have taken, the appeal has no substance and is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs, but the court fee will be recovered from the appellant\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

was settled by sharing the rent in or about 1969.The appellant is one of the owners of the property in question deriving their title and right from the said Sail Nawaz Jung\tFacts\nOn or about 3rd February,1970 the Collector issued notice for acquisition of the property u/s.7(1) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act,1952 being Act 30 of 1952\tFacts\nhereinafter called the Central Act).The Gazette Notification for the acquisition was issued on 12th March,1970.The controversy in this case relates to the question whether Abdul Khader was 'a protected tenant' under the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area\tFacts\nTenancy and Agricultural Lands Act,1950 being\tFacts\nAct No.XXI of 1950\tFacts\nhereinafter called the Andhra Pradesh Act\tFacts\nThe purpose of the said Act as the Preamble states was,inter alia,to enable the land-holders to prevent the excessive sub-division of agricultural holdings and empower government to assume in certain circumstances the management of agricultural lands,to provide for the registration of Co-operative Farms and to make further provision for matters incidental thereto\tFacts\nS.2(r) states that the expression 'protected' means a person who is deemed to be a protected tenant under the provisions of the said Act\tStatute\nChapter IV of the Andhra Pradesh Act deals with protected tenants and s.34 of the said Act provides who is to be considered as a protected tenant and uses the expression that a person shall,subject to the provisions of sub-ss.(2) and (3),be deemed to be a protected tenant in respect of the land if he has fulfilled the conditions mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-s.(1) of S.34 of the said Act\tStatute\nSub-s.(2) of S.34 of the said Act also deals with \"to be deemed to be a protected tenant in respect of any land\",for certain purposes\tStatute\nS.35 of the said Act deals with decision on claims and stipulates by sub-s.(1) of S.35 of the said Act that if any question arises whether any

entitled to be deemed to be protected tenant or as the case may be,that no person is so entitled\tStatute\nSub-s.(2) of S.35 stipulates that a declaration by the Tahsildar that the person is deemed to be a protected tenant or,in the event of an appeal from the Tahsildar's decision such declaration by the Collector on first appeal or by the Board of Revenue on second appeal,shall be conclusive that such person is a protected tenant and his rights as such shall be recorded in the Record of Right of where there is no Record of Rights in such village record as may be prescribed\tStatute\nS.36 of

protected tenant shall form sixty per cent\tStatute\nIt is necessary also to note the provisions of s.99 of the Act\tStatute\nIt is as follows: \"99.Bar of Jurisdiction:-(1\tStatute\nSave as provided in this Act\tStatute\nno Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to settle,decide or deal with any question which is by or under this Act required to be settled,decided or dealt with by the

questioned in any Civil or Criminal Court\tStatute\nS.102 of the said Act stipulates that the Act shall not apply to certain lands and areas and provides inter alia as follows: \"102.Nothing in this Act shall apply-- To lands leased,granted,alienated or acquired in favour of or by the Central Government or the State Government,a local authority or a Cooperative Society\tStatute\nIt is relevant at this stage to refer to certain provisions of the Central Act to consider the controversy involved in this appeal.the Central Act was enacted giving power for requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property for Union purposes\tRatio of the decision\nS.3 of the said Act gave power to requisition immovable property\tStatute\nS.4 of the said Act empowers taking possession of requisitioned property\tStatute\nS.5 deals with rights over requisitioned property\tStatute\nS.6 deals with the power of release from the requisitioning\tStatute\nS.7 authorises the Central Government where it is

compensation and provides that the amount of compensation payable under an award shall,subject to any rules made under that Act,be paid by a competent authority to the person or persons entitled thereto in such manner and within such time as may be specified in the award\tStatute\nSuspecting that the entry in the Protected Tenancy Register might not be genuine,on or about 24th of October,1970 the Tahsildar passed an order cancelling that entry\tFacts\nThe main question centres around the right of Abdul Khader,respondent No.1 herein to the compensation awarded by the arbitrator,it is therefore,necessary to refer to the relevant portion of the said order which inter alia,stated as follows: \"By perusal of the Tenancy Register of 1958 it is evident that Sri Mohd\tFacts\nAbdul Khader is not a genuine protected tenant\tFacts\nThe entries of this particular so called tenant is doubtful\tFacts\nI suspect that somebody has tampered the register and entered the name of Sri Mohd\tFacts\nAbdul Khader\tFacts\nSeparate enquiry in this connection is going on in this office to know under what circumstances such entry has been made and copy also issued without knowledge of the Tahsildar\tFacts\nHence I suspect the entry and order to cancel the copy of the tenancy issued in favour of Sri Modh\tFacts\nSd- Tahsildar\tFacts\nHyderabad West Taluk\tFacts\nThis order of cancellation was challenged by Abdul Khadar by filing a writ petition in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh being W .P.No.1786 of 197 1 and by judgment and order passed on 27th August,197\tFacts\n1,the learned single Judge,Vaidya,J.held,inter alia,as follows: \"Whether the petitioner (Abdul Khader) is a protected tenant or whether he has any prima facie interest in the suit property are matters entirely within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator who has to be appointed under S.8 of the 'Central Act\tFacts\nIn the appeal of Abdul Khader the proceedings of Revenue Divisional Officer while questioning entry of the name of Abdul Khader in the Register is a genuine one or net and while it is stated that it was entered in the Register in such suspicious way by giving Serial No.1/A between Serial Nos.1 and 2 of Register being Exhibit A.106 and Exhibit A.107,it ultimately held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant under section 37A of the Andhra Pradesh Act\tFacts\nOn or about 19th of April,1972\tFacts\nthe order was passed by the District Revenue Officer who held that Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant\tFacts\nHe held further that Khasra Pahani which is the basic record of occupancy period after spot inspections does not find the name of Abdul Khader and further held that all entries except this entry in the Protected Tenancy Register prepared under section 37A of the Andhra Pradesh Act was supported by an enquiry\tFacts\nIt was in those circumstances held by him that the entry was a spurious one\tFacts\nIn Civil Revision Petition No.1006 of 1972 which was filed by Abdul Khader as against others,Justice R.Ramachandra Raju of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on or about 19th August,1974 held that Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant and directed deletion of entry made in the Final Record of tenancies as a spurious one\tFacts\nThe learned Judge observed,inter alia,as follows: \"I am told by the counsel for both the parties that the lands in question were already acquired for military purpose under the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable property Act,1952 and that Sri M.S.Sharma,the Additional Chief Judge,City Civil Court,Hyderabad has already been appointed as Arbitrator under the Act for determining the compensation and the persons entitled to it\tRuling by Lower Court\nNot only that,in the writ petition filed by the present petitioner in this Court,it was held that it is not necessary to go into the question whether the petitioner is a protected tenant or whether he has any prima facie interest in the property because they are the matters entirely within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator who has to be appointed under S.8 of the Act\tRuling by Lower Court\nNow,as the arbitrator has already been appointed,he will go into the matter as to whether the petitioner was a protected tenant of the lands or not and if he was the protected tenant to what share in the compensation amount he would be entitled to\tRuling by Lower Court\nUnder these circumstances,the C.R.P.is dismissed with a direction that the entry made in the Final Record of Tenancies that the petitioner was the protected tenant,for the lands in question which is spurious as found by both the Revenue Divisional Officer and the District Revenue Officer should be deleted\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe matter was brought to this Court by a special leave application and this Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil\tRuling by Present Court\nNo.10 of 1975 on or about 30th January.1975 held that since the question whether the petitioner in that case namely,Abdul Khader was a protected tenant had been left open by the High Court to be decided by the Arbitrator u/s.8 of the Central Act,special leave petition was rejected with those observations\tRuling by Present Court\nThereafter there was an order appointing arbitrator on 29th of March,1975\tRuling by Present Court\nu/s.8(1)(b) of the Central Act\tRuling by Present Court\nClaim petition was filed by the appellant before the arbitrator' Claim petition was also filed by Abdul Khader claiming 60'% of compensation as a 'protected tenant\tRuling by Present Court\nThere was an award by the arbitrator holding that as this Court had left it open to decide whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant\tFacts\nDespite the objection exercising the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to go into the question of protected tenant,the arbitrator held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant\tFacts\nAggrieved by the aforesaid award,the appellant claiming as one of the owners of the property filed a statutory appeal to the High Court\tFacts\nIn the meantime Abdul Khader filed an application on or about 21st of October,1984 for adducing additional evidence to mark Kaulnama dated 2nd of December,1950 for the first time and Oubuliatnama dated 2nd December,1950 as exhibits in deciding the protected tenancy rights\tFacts\nThe appellant objected to that application but the High Court on 1st April,1985\tFacts\nappointed Advocate Commissioner to record additional evidence\tFacts\nOn or about 22nd of April,1985\tFacts\nthe appellant filed the objection reserving the right of raising the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to go into the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant in the light of the Act 21 of 1950.Three civil appeals were filed before this Court against the order of the High Court on 15th May,1985.This Court passed the order,on 19th August,1985.The said order is important and reads as follows:- \"Special leave are granted\tFacts\nThe appeal is heard\tFacts\nDr\tFacts\nChitale learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court should be directed to consider the issues relating to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator appointed and functioning under the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act,195 i to decide whether a person is protected tenant of an agricultural land or not in the light of Ss.99 and 102 of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area\tFacts\nTenancy and Agricultural Land Act,1950.We have heard the learned counsel for the respondents on the above question\tFacts\nAfter giving our due consideration to the question we are of the view that the High Court should determine this question\tFacts\nThe High Court shall decide the question of jurisdiction referred to above in light of the submissions to be made by both the parties\tFacts\nShri Subba Rao,learned counsel for the respondents submits that the appellants should not be permitted to withdraw from the authorities concerned more than 40 per cent of the total compensation awarded in respect of the lands in question pending disposal of the appeal before the High Court\tFacts\nWe agree with his submission\tFacts\nWe direct that the appellants shall withdraw not more than 40 per cent of the compensation pending disposal of the appeal before the High Court\tFacts\nThe remaining 60 per cent shall be disbursed in accordance with the directions to be given by the High Court after hearing all the parties concerned\tFacts\nThe appeals were disposed of accordingly\tFacts\nOther C.M.Ps.were filed for clarification of the second part of the order dated 19th August,1985 and this Court on 29th November,1985 in CMPs\tFacts\nNos.4692 to 4694 of 1985 clarified and ob-served that there was no need for further clarification\tFacts\nIt was observed that the High Court was at liberty to consider the claims to be made by both the parties and pass any fresh order with regard to the disbursement of the remaining 60% of the compensation\tFacts\nThe judgment under appeal was passed on 15th of April,1986.This appeal arises out of the said judgment\tFacts\nIn the judgment under appeal which is directed against the award made by the arbitrator formulated the following four issues--(1) what is the value of the land; (2) who are entitled to the compensation amount; (3) whether Abdul Khader is a protected tenant of Sail Gulshan of the area 19-02 guntas excluding the land of buildings,wells,etc.and (4) what share is to be apportioned to successors of Sail Nawaz Jung\tFacts\nIt has to be borne in mind that in the award,the arbitrator after exhaustively discussing the evidence on record held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant and as such further held that he was entitled to 60% of the compensation money payable for the acquisition of the land excluding the land of buildings,wells etc\tFacts\nIn this appeal we are concerned with the question whether the High Court was right in upholding the award of the arbitrator so far as it has held in favour of Abdul Khader and his rights to get 60% of the compensation\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court dealt with the value of the land\tRatio of the decision\nWe are not concerned with the challenge to this aspect in this appeal\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court further modified a portion of the order in view of the decision of this Court in Bhag Singh v\tFacts\nUnion Territory of Chandigarh\tFacts\nA.I.R.1985 S.C.1576 1985 Indlaw SC 246 on the question of solarium and interest on the amount awarded\tFacts\nThe judgment also dealt with the question as to who were the successors of Nawaz Jung\tFacts\nWe are also not concerned with this aspect of the matter inasmuch as the same is the subject matter of another appeal being Civil Appeal No.4406 of 1986\tRatio of the decision\nWe are concerned in this appeal with the right of Abdul Khader\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court discussed 18 documents out of which two are challans and other depositions\tFacts\nKowlnama executed in favour of Shaik Hussain was not filed\tFacts\nThe Kowlnama executed in favour of the son,Mohd\tFacts\nAbdul Khader,on December 3,1950 was filed and was marked as Exhibit C-1.The document recited: \"permitted to utilise garden fruits,flowers and mango\tFacts\nfruits\".The tenant was permitted to raise flower trees at his own expenses\tFacts\nThe High Court took into consideration the judgment in Suit No.13(1) of 195 1-52 by the tenant\tFacts\nThe High Court on consideration of these documents was of the view that these documents showed unequivocally that the tenancy was in favour of Shaik Hussain from 1935.After his death Mohd\tFacts\nAbdul Khader was recognised as the tenant\tFacts\nThe land was taken possession of under a panchanama dated 12th of September,1963.According to the High Court the documents discussed in the judgment indicated that Shaik Hussain was a tenant from 1935.After his death on July 18,1949,his son Mohd\tFacts\nAbdul Khader became a tenant\tFacts\nIn this background the Court addressed itself to the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant or not entitled to 60% of the compensation\tFacts\nNo document was filed to show that Abdul Khader was declared by the revenue courts as a protected tenant\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court was of the view that there was surfeit of evidence prior to the commencement of the Andhra Pradesh Act that Shaik Hussain was a tenant of the land\tFacts\nThe question was whether on enforcement of the said Act Abdul Khader,respondent herein,was a protected tenant\tFacts\nThe High Court thereafter discussed the facts mentioned hereinbefore about the order of the District Revenue Officer and the orders of this Court referred to hereinbefore\tFacts\nThe High Court noticed the position that under the said Andhra Pradesh Act it was for the revenue authorities to order whether a tenant is a protected tenant under section 34,s.37 'and section 37A of the said Act\tFacts\nSection 37A was enacted on 12th of March,1956.The High Court was,however,of the view that it cannot be said that it was for the revenue authorities alone to decide the issue because the arbitrator was ordered to decide the issue by the High Court on 19th August,1974 and by this Court on 30th of January,1975.The High Court also referred to the directions of this Court dated 19th August,1985 mentioned hereinbefore\tFacts\nThe High Court was of the view that the arbitrator was to decide that question and the arbitrator was not in error in deciding the issue in the manner it did\tFacts\nThe Court reiterated that there was surfeit of evidence to declare that Abdul Khader was a tenant\tFacts\nIf he was a tenant,the High Court observed.he was a protected tenant under s.34 read with s.37 or under section 37-A of the Andhra Pradesh Act\tFacts\nThe High Court on reciting the facts came to the conclusions,inter alia\tRuling by Lower Court\na) that Abdul Khader because he was a tenant between January,1942 to January,1948 for six years,therefore,was a protected tenant under sub-cl.(ii) of cl.(1) of s.34 of the Andhra Pradesh Act; (b) that Abdul Khader held the land from October,1943 to October,1949,therefore,was a protected tenant of Sail Gulshan under sub-cl.(iii) of cl.(1) of s.34 of Act 21 of 1950.In these circumstances,the High Court held that Adbul Khader was entitled to 60% of the compensation paid\tRuling by Lower Court\nAggrieved by the aforesaid decision,the appellants being the successor of the owner of the land in question is in appeal before us\tRatio of the decision\nShri Shanker Ghosh,learned counsel for the appellant,urged that under the said Andhra Pradesh Act it was mandatory under s.99 read with s.102 of the said Act in conjunction with the definition of s.2(r) of the Act for the revenue authorities to decide whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant or not\tArgument\nThere being no such finding by the revenue officer,on the other hand there being a finding mat Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant by the revenue authorities it was not open to the arbitrator to decide the question of protected tenancy\tRatio of the decision\nThe arbitrator therefore,exceeded his jurisdiction and the High Court was in error\tRatio of the decision\nShri A.K.Sen,on behalf of the respondents on the other hand contended that the compensation payable in respect of the requisitioning and acquisition must be determined under the Central Act and the arbitrator was the authority to decide that question\tArgument\nThe question of Abdul Khader's right to compensation had to be decided in accordance with law\tArgument\nHe had claimed rights of a protected tenant\tArgument\nHe had sought to establish his rights which must be found within the four corners of the Andhra Pradesh Act along with other documents because u/s.40(4) of the Andhra Pradesh Act the interest of a protected tenant in the land held by him as a protected tenant formed 60%.The rights of the protected tenants have been defined in the Andhra Pradesh Act and relevant provisions of that Act namely,sections 34,37,37A and 40 in conjunction with the definition under s.2(r) have to be taken into consideration in the background of the facts and circumstances of the case\tArgument\nThe two orders of this Court as we have mentioned hereinbefore dated 30th of January,1975 and 19th of August.1985 reiterated the position that it was for the arbitrator to decide the question and he should decide the question in the light of ss.99 and 102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act as set out hereinbefore\tArgument\nOn behalf of the appellant it was submitted that there was a complete bar for any civil court to go into the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant and as such the arbitrator and the High Court had no jurisdiction to decide this question\tArgument\nFor this reliance was placed on S.102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act which lays down that the Act will not apply to lands leased,granted,alienated or acquired in favour of or by the Central Government or the State Government etc.and on -S.99 of the Act which bars the jurisdiction of civil courts to deal with any question which is under the Andhra Pradesh Act required to be settled,to be decided or dealt with by the Tahsildar,Tribunal or Collector\tArgument\nAccording to the appellant inasmuch as whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant had not to be settled by the Collector or the Tribunal,the arbitrator and the High Court were in error in going to that question\tArgument\nWe are unable to accept this submission\tRatio of the decision\nBy the scheme of the Central Act compensation was payable to persons who had interest in the land acquired\tRatio of the decision\nWho are the persons who have interest in the land had to be decided in accordance with the law and the evidence\tRatio of the decision\nDetermination by the revenue authorities and non-determination is not conclusive or decisive\tRatio of the decision\nIt is clear that s.102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act mentions that after acquisition the Act was not to apply in respect of certain land\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,it was submitted by the respondents that s.99 of the Andhra Pradesh Act.which made the determination by the Tahsildar to be final and debarred other courts from going into the question did not apply in case of compensation payable\tRatio of the decision\nIn the background of the totality of circumstances as manifest in the different orders it appeared to the arbitrator and the Court that the entry which was made in favour of Abdul Khader as the protected tenant was of doubtful validity\tRatio of the decision\nWe are of the opinion that the High Court was not in error in so holding\tRatio of the decision\nIt was the observation of the revenue authorities that it was spurious\tRatio of the decision\nThat in any event what was the interest of Abdul Khader had to be determined in determining the question of payment of compensation to him and in so determining the facts and circumstances and the proceedings before the revenue authorities and entries and subsequent deletions had to be taken into consideration by the arbitrator\tRatio of the decision\nThe arbitrator has done so\tRatio of the decision\nHe had jurisdiction to do so\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court has so held\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court by the two orders referred to hereinbefore had also affirmed this position\tRatio of the decision\nIn that view of the matter we are unable to accept the challenge to the award\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore,under s.99 of the Andhra Pradesh Act the bar was not against the arbitrator but against a civil court\tRatio of the decision\nIn determining the amount of compensation payable to Abdul Khader under the Central Act,his interests in the property had to be determined\tRatio of the decision\nIn another context,the High Court of Andhra Pradesh enunciated the position that it was necessary to determine the interest of the persons claiming compensation\tRatio of the decision\nReference may be made to the decision in the case of Archi Appalareddi and another v\tPrecedent\nSpecial Tahsildar,land Acquisition,Visakhapatnam Municipality and mother,[1979] Andhra Weekly Reporter,Vol.1 p.101,where the Court observed in the context of the Land Acquisition Act that a tenant was a 'person interested' as defined in clause (b) of s.3 of the Land Acquisition Act\tPrecedent\nHe has a right to object to the acquisition and/or the quantum of compensation\tPrecedent\nThe Land Acquisition Officer or the Court,as the case may be,had to ascertain the value of a claimant's right in the property acquired and compensate him in that behalf\tRatio of the decision\nWe may mention that in the two orders of this Court dated 30th of January,1975 and 19th of August,1985 referred to herein before,this Court had left it open to the High Court and to the arbitrator to decide whether he is a protected tenant or not.the arbitrator has decided that question and the High Court found over whelming evidence in support of it\tRatio of the decision\nIn that view of the matter we must uphold that decision however unsatisfactory\tRatio of the decision\nit might appear that a fruit pucker gets 60% of the compensation while the owners get only If that is the law\tRatio of the decision\nlet it be\tRatio of the decision\nIn the aforesaid view of the matter this appeal must fail and is accordingly dismissed with costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

and 12.7.1993.Appellant is said to have commenced its business of manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps also under the mark 'Field Marshall\tFacts\nAllegedly,on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and,thus,acquired a reputation in that behalf,a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963\tFacts\nRespondent No.1 thereafter filed a suit in the Delhi High Court for grant of a

appeared on behalf of the defendant.16.1.1987 was the date fixed in the said suit\tFacts\nAppellant's counsel appeared on that date and,inter alia,contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled\tArgument\nIn view of that statement,a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action\tArgument\nThe learned Judge directed recording of statements of the learned counsel in this behalf; pursuant whereto the same were recorded which reads as under : \"C.O.9 of 1986\tFacts\nMr\tFacts\nSingh has filed a reply in this petition bringing out that presently he is the registered owner of the trademark which is sought to

for hearing before a learned Single Judge of the High Court\tFacts\nBy an order dated 19.1.1988,having regard to the provisions contained in the said Act,the learned Judge opined that appellant having

transferred to the Intellectual Property Appellate Board\tFacts\nThe said application was dismissed\tFacts\nA writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent\tFacts\nA learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court,however,refused to stay the operation of the order of the Board dated 27.10.2004.An appeal was preferred there against\tFacts\nThe Division Bench of the High Court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the Letters Patent Appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the Board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits\tFacts\nThe said order of the Division Bench is under challenge in this appeal\tFacts\nThe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case,the application under S.46(1)(b) was maintainable\tRatio of the decision\nBefore adverting thereto,we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions : Ss.46(1)(b),48(1),48(2) and 56 read as under: \"Section 46--Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use--(1) Subject to the provisions of section 47,a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either-- (a\tStatute\nb) that up to a date one month before the date of the application,a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being: Provided that,except where the applicant has been permitted under sub-s.(3) of s.12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,the tribunal may refuse an application u/cl.(a) or cl.(b) in relation to any goods,if it is shown that there has been,before the relevent date or during the relevant period,as the case may be,bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description,being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered\tStatute\nSection 48--Registered users--(1) Subject to the provisions of section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark; but the Central Government may,by rules made in this behalf,provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks\tStatute\nThe permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof,and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor,for the purposes of s.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law\tStatute\nSection 56--Power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register--(1\tStatute\nOn application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved,the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention,or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto\tStatute\nAny person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry,or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause,or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register,or by any error of defect in any entry in the ' register,may apply in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar,and the tribunal may make such order for making,expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit\tStatute\nThe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register\tStatute\nThe tribunal,of its own motion,may,after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard,make any order referred to in sub-s.(1) or sub-s.(2\tStatute\nAny order of the High Court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the Registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly\tStatute\nThe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in Part A of the register to Part B of the register\tStatute\nIndisputably,the scope of the provisions for removal from Register in terms of S.46 and 56 of the Act stand on different footings\tRatio of the decision\nWhereas S.46 had a limited application,S.56 of the Act is wider in nature\tRatio of the decision\nConcededly,cl.(a) of sub-s.(1) of S.46 is not attracted in the case\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions,we may notice the findings of the Board as also the High Court\tFacts\nThe Board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which Thukral became the proprietor of the trademark,that is,30th May,1986 and,therefore,the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991.Opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable,the application was dismissed\tFacts\nThe High Court on the other hand opined: \"It was not anybody's case before us that M/s Jain Industries\tFacts\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all\tFacts\nThe trademark was used by the Appellant and Thukral,neither of whom were proprietors thereof,except that Thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th May,1986.According to learned counsel for the Appellant,the use of the trademark by Thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as Thukral did not have the consent,tacit or otherwise of M/s\tFacts\nJain Industries to use the trademark\tFacts\nIf Thukral did,then it cannot be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor\tFacts\nthat is,M/s Jain Industries\tFacts\nThis appears to be the position at least till 30th May,1986.In\tFacts\nthe meantime,as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th December 1985 by this Court in Suit No.2408 of 1985,there was no question of Thukral using the trademark Field Marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th January,1988\tFacts\nThe Act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise\tRatio of the decision\nRegistration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years\tRatio of the decision\nRenewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years\tRatio of the decision\nM/s\tRatio of the decision\nJain Industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the Act\tRatio of the decision\nFirst Respondent withdrew the application against M/s\tRatio of the decision\nJain Industries\tRatio of the decision\nThe prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps (goods) so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned\tRatio of the decision\nIt is in the aforementioned situation,we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words 'for the time being' occurring in S.46(1)(b) of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nTwo interpretations thereto which are possible are: (1) the said words would denote non-use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer; and (2) The mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor\tRatio of the decision\nWe may,however,also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nSunderam,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant,that the word 'proprietor' would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become 'proprietor' by long use thereof\tRatio of the decision\nThe words 'for the time being' would mean differently in different situations\tRatio of the decision\nIt may mean 'the moment or existing position' as was held by this Court in the case of Jivendra Nath Kaul v\tPrecedent\nCollector/District Magistrate and Anr.[(1992\tPrecedent\n3 SCC 576 1992 Indlaw SC 1107] or in the context of cl.(22) of Art.366 of the Constitution as has been held in H.H.Maharajadhiraja\tPrecedent\nMadhav Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia

mean: \"By the use of the expression \"for the time being\" in Cl.(22) of Art.366\tPrecedent\nthe President is not invested with authority to accord a temporary recognition to a Ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a Ruler arbitrarily : the expression \"for them time being\" predicts that there shall be a Ruler of the Indian State,that if the first recognized Ruler dies,or ceases to be a Ruler,a successor shall be appointed,and that there shall not be more Rulers than one at a given time\tPrecedent\nThe terms also may bring within its umbrage the entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nThere cannot be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right\tRatio of the decision\nThe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner\tRatio of the decision\nIt confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered\tRatio of the decision\nThe same is an assignable right in terms of S.36 of the Act,whereas an unregistered trade mark is not\tRatio of the decision\nNon\tRatio of the decision\nuser of the said mark,therefore,entails the consequences laid down under cl.(b) of Sub-s.(1) of S.46\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the applicant before the Board establishes the fact in regard to non-user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner,the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub-s.(3) of S.46\tRatio of the decision\nThe question which,therefore,arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration\tRatio of the decision\nIndisputably,it would be the registered proprietor\tRatio of the decision\nS.46 is a penal provision\tRatio of the decision\nIt provides for civil or evil consequences\tRatio of the decision\nIt takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor\tRatio of the decision\nIt,therefore,can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied\tRatio of the decision\nWhile we say so,we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged\tRatio of the decision\nA registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time\tRatio of the decision\nBut then such a case has to be made out\tRatio of the decision\nAllegation of trafficking is a serious one\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made\tRatio of the decision\nAt the time of grant of original registration,advertisements are issued and objections are called for\tRatio of the decision\nRenewal of registration,in a sense,also is not automatic\tRatio of the decision\nA person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof\tRatio of the decision\nThe non-user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration\tRatio of the

thereof,he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage\tRatio of the decision\nIf the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use,he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non-user on the part of his predecessor\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non-use of the present registered owner\tRatio of the decision\nIt must,however,be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact\tRatio of the decision\nWhether S.46(1)(b) read with S.48 of the Act would bring within its purview,not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise

obtained an or of injunction\tRatio of the decision\nThe order of injunction was vacated\tRatio of the decision\nFor one reason or the other,the said order attained finality\tRatio of the decision\nPrima facie,therefore,appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nIt is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification,the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law\tRatio of the decision\nbut it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non-user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of making out such a case,both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties\tRatio of the decision\nWe may,at this stage,notice that in Law of Trade Marks by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nK.C.Kailasam,while commenting on S.47 of the Trade Marks Act,1999 to which our attention has been drawn by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nSudhir Chandra,it is stated\tRatio of the decision\nNotes on clauses\tRatio of the decision\nThis clause corresponds to s.46 of the existing Act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non-use\tRatio of the decision\nA trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration,becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used\tRatio of the decision\nUnder S.46(1),it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register\tRatio of the decision\nThis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity,as for all other purposes,the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl.23(2).Proviso to sub-cl.(1) also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl.47(1)(a) and (b) in which use of the trade mark,prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark,shall be disregarded\tRatio of the decision\nThis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the Act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed.?Sub-cl.(3) protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non-use if such non-use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade\tRatio of the decision\nThe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in India\tRatio of the decision\nConsequential amendments have been made to cover services.(Cl.47 of the Bill\tRatio of the decision\nThe Court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof\tRatio of the decision\nIt seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment\tRatio of the decision\nThus,a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out\tRatio of the decision\nSuch an application may be maintainable in terms of S.56 of the Act but strictly not in terms of S.46(1)(b) thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor\tRatio of the decision\nWe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non-use of the registered trade mark against M/s Jain Industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant; firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction; secondly,because want and/or lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Tribunal cannot be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction,the same would be a nullity; and thirdly because the cause of action,even according to the first respondent in his application before the High Court,was different\tRatio of the decision\nThe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non-impleadment of M/s\tRatio of the decision\nJain Industries was concerned\tRatio of the decision\nIt only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self-same cause of action\tRatio of the decision\nThe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage\tRatio of the decision\nThe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against M/s\tRatio of the decision\nJain Industries was non-user thereof by it\tRatio of the decision\nIts non-user and rectification of the register could not,in the aforementioned situation,have been tagged with the cause of action,if any,against the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe second contention of Mr\tRatio of the decision\nthat the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact\tRatio of the decision\nThe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis-'-vis M/s\tRatio of the decision\nJain Industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending\tRatio of the decision\nThe Board could not,while exercising its jurisdiction under S.46(1)(b),of the Act proceeded on the basis of such presumption\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not correct that no cause of action survived against Jain Industries\tRatio of the decision\nIt was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel\tRatio of the decision\nIn the suit,only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against M/s\tRatio of the decision\nSuch a right cannot be determined in a proceeding under S.46(1)(b) of the Act which is restricted to non-user of the registered trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nBoth the appellant and the respondent No.1 were the infringers of the right of M/s\tRatio of the decision\nJain Industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question,namely,centrifugal pumps\tRatio of the decision\nTwo interpretations of the said provision S.46(1)(b) are possible\tRatio of the decision\nWhile interpreting the same,however,certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind\tRatio of the decision\nAs it takes away somebody's right,it deserves strict construction\tRatio of the decision\nJurisdiction of the Board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts,the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise\tRatio of the decision\nThe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month\tRatio of the decision\nIt does not provide for a 'sun set' law\tRatio of the decision\nIt has to be adjudicated upon\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding\tRatio of the decision\nThe principle of 'purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiries',therefore,cannot apply in a case of this nature\tRatio of the decision\nSo long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid,once the same is validly assigned,the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute\tRatio of the decision\nA title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the Act cannot be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment,the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished\tRatio of the decision\nBoth the findings of the High Court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of Mr\tRatio of the decision\nSudhir Chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the Board cannot be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar\tRatio of the decision\nOur attention has again been drawn to a passage from 'Law of Trade marks & Geographical Indications' by Shri K.C.Kailasam,wherein the judgment of the Tribunal has been criticized in the following terms : \"From the above legislative intent,it would seem that the period of non-use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of American Home Products Corporation v\tRatio of the decision\nMac Laboratories Pvt.Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nRendered under the 1958 Act,it was held by the Supreme Court that \"the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove\tRatio of the decision\nsuch continuous non-user.\" It would appear that neither the U.K.Act,nor the Indian Act,at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non-use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark,so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration,every-time there is change in the ownership of the mark\tRatio of the decision\nIf that be so,any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s.47(1)(a) and (b).Further,it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to \"the provisions of the Act and any rights vested in any other person\" -See\tRatio of the decision\ns.37.The assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the Act\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct\tRatio of the decision\nAn assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses\tRatio of the decision\nIf his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non-user of the trade mark for a period of five years,any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra\tRatio of the decision\nFor the views we have taken,we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment cannot be sustained\tRuling by Present Court\nIt is set aside accordingly\tRuling by Present Court\nThe Board shall,however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeal is allowed with costs\tRuling by Present Court\nCounsel's fee assessed at Rs.1,00,000\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

institutions which are claimed to be Minority Educational Institutions,the petitioners have questioned the applicability of the scheme framed by this Court in J.P.Unni Krishnan v\tRatio of the decision\nState of A.P.(1993\tRatio of the decision\n1 SCC 645 1993 Indlaw SC 1056\tRatio of the decision\nI as well as the applicability of the rules and orders made by several State Governments on the basis of the said decision\tRatio of the decision\nBy order dated October 7,1993 passed by the Constitution Bench three questions were referred for consideration by a larger Bench\tFacts\nIn,pursuance of the said order,this Bench has been constituted\tFacts\nWhen the matters were taken up on March 16,1994,the Court felt that it was necessary to reframe the first two questions\tRatio of the decision\nThe hearing of the matters was,therefore,adjourned to March 18,1994,on which date the questions requiring consideration by this Bench have been reframed to highlight the several aspects of the claims put forward by the petitioners\tRatio of the decision\nThe claim of being a \"minority\" -whether based on religion or language -and the claim of being a \"Minority Educational Institution\" put forward by the petitioners cannot be pronounced upon without first ascertaining what the said expressions connote and signify\tRatio of the decision\nHaving regard to the importance of the questions involved we consider it appropriate to issue notice to the Attorney General of India as well as the Advocates General for the States\tRatio of the decision\nIt would,therefore,not be feasible to take up the hearing of these matters before the Court closes for the long vacation\tRatio of the decision\nSince the process of selection of candidates for admission for the next academic session is to commence soon,it is necessary to pass an interim order governing admission to the professional courses in Minority Educational Institutions for the next academic session\tRatio of the decision\nFor admission in the last academic session 1993-94,an interim order in the following terms was made by a Bench comprising Hon'ble the Chief Justice and one of us (Justice B.P.Jeevan Reddy) on May 14,1993 in Writ Petition Nos.350 and 355 of 1993\tFacts\nWe have heard Shri Soli J.Sorabjee,learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners in these two writ petitions\tFacts\nIssue rule\tFacts\nThere will be an interim order in the following terms: (i) Fifty per cent of the total intake in the petitioners' educational institutions shall be permitted to be filled up by candidates selected by the agencies of the State Government on the basis of a competitive examination/test\tFacts\nThe candidates so selected and admitted shall pay scales of fee as applicable to this class of students as determined by the State Government from time to time\tFacts\nii\tFacts\nThe remaining fifty per cent of the intake may be regulated by the petitioners to admit candidates belonging to the particular religious or linguistic minority\tFacts\nHowever,the selection shall be made strictly on the basis of merit among the candidates seeking admission to the institutions\tFacts\nSuch merit shall be determined oh the basis of the academic performance at the qualifying examination; or on the basis of any objective test that the institution might itself apply to determine such relative and competing merits; or on the basis of performance of the results of the selection tests that the State Government may itself hold for selecting candidates for admission to technical colleges in the State\tFacts\nIt is optional for the petitioners to adopt any one of these three modes and apply it uniformally\tFacts\nCandidates so selected on the basis of merit amongst the minorities shall,however,abide by such condition in the matter of payment of tuition and other fee as may be permitted by the State Government\tFacts\nIt is made clear that this order is made on the assumption that the petitioners are minority institutions\tRatio of the decision\nIt is open to the respondents to question this status claimed by the petitioners\tRatio of the decision\nThis order shall,however,not estop the petitioners from urging all other contentions raised in the writ petitions,as,indeed,this interim interlocutory order is made on the consent of the petitioners and without prejudice to all the contentions\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter the matter was considered by the Constitution Bench in its order dated August 18,19932.In that order the writ petitions placed before the Bench were categorised into five categories,namely,(1) unaided Minority Educational Institutions,(2\tFacts\nMinority Educational Institutions which are in receipt of State funds by way of aid,(3) Minority Educational Institutions in respect of which it is not clear from the averments in the writ petitions whether they are aided or unaided institutions,(4\tFacts\nwrit petitions challenging the correctness and applicability of Unni Krishnan' filed by educational institutions which do not claim to be Minority Educational Institutions,(5) writ petitions which do not fall in any of the above categories\tFacts\nIt was directed that the order dated May 14,1993,would not apply to educational institutions falling in categories (4) and (5) and the institutions referred to in paragraph 18 of the order dated August 18,1993.The order dated May 14,1993,was made applicable to the institutions falling in categories (1),(2) and (3) with the modification that following were added in continuation of the said order: \" In continuation it is made further clear that whether any of the petitioner-institutions is a MEI or not is a matter for the Government to verify and determine\tFacts\nWe do not more particularly at this stage -make any pronouncement in that behalf\tFacts\nThis order shall be Shahal H.Musaliar v\tFacts\nState of Kerala,(1993) 4 SCC\tFacts\n112 1993 Indlaw SC 575 applicable only to those institutions which are found to be MEIs on verification by the Government and not to those who are not found to be MEIs on such verification\tFacts\nThe 50% seats to be filled up by candidates selected by the agencies of the State Government on the basis of a competitive examination/test as well as the remaining 50% seats to be filled in accordance with cl.of the said order shall be equally distributed between free seats and payment seats\tFacts\nIn other words,out of the 50% seats to be filled up by Government,half will be payment seats and half will be free seats\tFacts\nSimilarly,out of the 50% of the seats to be filled up by the Management in accordance  of the said order,half shall be payment seats and the other half free seats\tFacts\nThe NRIS,if any admitted to an extent not exceeding 5% of the total seats shall be out of the payment seats to be filled under After completing the admissions each of the colleges,shall submit to the competent authority,to the University to which it is affiliated and to the Government concerned statements containing full particulars of the students admitted under cl.(ii) of para (2) of this order\tFacts\nSuch statements shall contain as full a particulars as possible\tFacts\nThe authorities to which the statements are submitted shall verify the correctness of the statements and,if they find any irregularity,they shall call upon the college concerned to rectify the same\tFacts\nThey shall also bring any such violation to the notice of this Court by way of any interlocutory application\tFacts\nAny such irregularity if proved may entail serious consequences\tFacts\nSeparate directions were,however,given in respect of institutions referred to in Writ Petitions Nos.284 and 482 of 1993.With regard to Writ Petition No.284 of 1993 it was observed that in the said writ petition the petitioner has claimed that no capitation fee is charged from any student and the fee charged is not more than (in some cases less than\tRatio of the decision\nthe fees charged in the government colleges and that the admission to these institutions is made on the basis of an All India Common Entrance Test separately conducted by the petitioner and admissions are made on the basis of merit as determined in the said test,and further that in view of the reputation of these institutions,thousands of students apply for and appear in the entrance test every year\tRatio of the decision\nIt was also observed that this fact was not disputed by the learned Advocate General for the State of Karnataka\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly as regards Writ Petition No.482 of 1993,it was observed that according to the petitioner in that case the medical college run by it at Vellore in the State of Tamil Nadu is a well-reputed institution,admission to which is made on the basis of All India entrance test conducted by the petitioner and that the admissions are made on the basis of merit and the fee charged by it is not more than the fees chargeable in similar governmental institutions and that there has never been any complaint about the working of this institution and it was observed that this fact was not disputed by Shri Seetharaman,learned counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu\tRatio of the decision\nIn the order dated August 18,1993,the following directions were given in respect of the institutions covered by the aforesaid Writ Petitions Nos.284 of 1993 and 482 of 19932 : \"Having regard to the above circumstances,we permit the petitioners\tFacts\nIn the above two writ petitions to admit students to their colleges on the basis of entrance test conducted by them and on the same basis on which admissions were made by them in the said colleges in the previous academic year\tFacts\nAfter completing the admissions,the petitioners shall furnish full particulars of the students admitted,the categories,if any,whereunder they were admitted and all other particulars relating to their admission\tFacts\nThis information should be furnished to the competent authority,to the University to which the said colleges are affiliated and to the Secretary,Education Department,Government of Karnataka/Tamil Nadu\tFacts\nThe said authorities shall verify whether the admissions have been made by the petitioners in accordance with the directions given herein\tFacts\nIn case of irregularity,any of the said authorities shall be entitled to call upon the petitioner to rectify the said irregularity\tFacts\nIt shall also be open to the competent authority,University and the Government of Karnataka/Tamil Nadu to bring any such irregularity to the notice of this Court by way of an interlocutory application for appropriate orders in that behalf\tFacts\nIt is made clear that any violation of the directions given herein by the petitioners shall entail serious consequences inasmuch as the above orders are made based upon their representations and even before a counter-affidavit has been filed by the respective respondents in view of the urgency expressed by them\tFacts\nDealing with Writ Petition No.598 of 1993,the Court,after noticing that an agreement was entered into between the institution and the Government of Kerala according to which while 85% of the seats were to be filled by the Government and the remaining 15% of the seats were left for the management to fill up in its discretion,observed that since the basic principle in Unni Krishnan' as well as the order dated August 18,1993 is that merit shall be the guiding principle in the matter of admission,a plea for discretionary quota could not be countenanced and it was directed that the said writ petition shall also be governed by the order dated May 14,1993,as modified by addition\tFacts\nBy order dated October 7,19933 the Constitution Bench having regard to the fact that the year 1993 being a year of transition and adjustment and also in view of the orders of the Government of India permitting admission of foreign students to the extent of as much as 50% of the seats as well as the time that had already elapsed,permitted the private professional colleges to admit non-resident Indians and foreign students up to a maximum extent of 15% of the intake capacity of that year\tFacts\ni.e.1993,with the direction that the basis of the said selection would be as indicated in order dated May 14,19934 on the basis of merit leaving to the management of the college T.M.A.Pai Foundation v\tFacts\nState of

regard to the relevant factors\tFacts\nIt was further made clear that this was a special provision made only for that year\tFacts\nIn the aforesaid order dated October 7,19933,with reference to the Minority Educational Institutions in the State of Kerala (such as those covered by Writ Petition No.598 of 1993) it has been observed: \"The system obtaining in Kerala appears to be altogether different which was unfortunately not brought to our notice on August 18,1993.There are only two private engineering colleges in the State,said to be Minority Educational Institutions\tFacts\nThe system obtaining in this State appears to be that the entire fees collected by these private engineering colleges has to be made over to the Government while the Government bears the entire expenditure for running the colleges\tFacts\nUnder this system,the colleges were allowed to admit students of their own choice to the extent of 15\tFacts\nWe have heard learned counsel for the parties and we are of the view that except for the Minority Educational Institutions in Kerala which are governed by the terms of the agreements with the Government of Kerala,the directions given by this Court with regard to admissions for the academic session 1993 can continue and govern admissions for the next academic session commencing in 1994.As regards the institutions in the State of Kerala which are governed by the terms of agreements with the Government of Kerala,the admissions to such institutions would be made in accordance with those agreements\tFacts\nIt is,therefore,directed that the admission for the academic session commencing in 1994 to the professional courses in the institutions which are claimed to be Minority Educational Institutions shall be made on the following basis: (i\tFacts\nIn the institutions referred to in Writ Petitions Nos.284 of 1993 and 482 of 1993 admission shall be made as per the directions given in the order dated August 18,19932,for the academic session commencing in 1993\tFacts\nIn the institutions referred to in Writ Petition No.598 of 1993 and similar Minority Educational Institutions in the State of Kerala which are governed by an agreement with the Government of Kerala the admissions shall be made in accordance with the terms of those agreements\tFacts\nIn respect of the seats which are left for management to fill in its discretion,merit shall be the guiding principle\tFacts\nSince the entire,expenditure of the colleges is borne by the State -the entire fees collected are also made over to the State -these colleges must be required to draw the students even with respect to the seats to be filled by the management from out of the State merit list,if any\tRatio of the decision\nIn the absence of such list,they can themselves devise the method for such selection\tRatio of the decision\nWe make it clear that regarding the character of these institutions -whether they are Minority Educational Institutions -we express no opinion\tRatio of the decision\nThat is a matter between the institutions and the Government of Kerala\tRatio of the decision\nIt is enough to record that Shri Vellapally,learned counsel for the State of Kerala,disputes the minority character of these institutions\tRatio of the decision\niii\tRatio of the decision\nIn rest of the Minority Educational Institutions falling in categories (1),(2) and (3) indicated in paragraph 5 of the order dated August 18,19932,admission shall be made in accordance with the directions contained in the order dated May 14,1993 in Writ Petitions Nos.350 and 355 of 1993 as modified by order dated August 18,19932,but the directions would not apply to the institutions referred to in paragraph 18 of the order dated August 18,19932.In this context,we would like to impress upon the managements of the institutions concerned that while assessing the merit of a candidate for admission the objective should be to promote the excellence of the institution as a vehicle of general secular education\tRatio of the decision\niv\tRatio of the decision\nInsofar as non-resident Indians and foreign students are concerned,the permissible limit would be only 5% of the total intake for a given year as per the direction contained in paragraph 6 of the order dated May 14,1993 as modified by order dated August 18,19932.The admission against these seats shall be made on the basis of merit\tRatio of the decision\nbut it would be open for the management of the institution to adjudge the merit of the candidates having regard to the relevant factors\tRatio of the decision\nThe matters be listed for hearing on July 20,1994.Notice be issued to the Attorney General of India and the Advocates General for the States on the questions as

appointment to the substantive posts in their quota under Rule 6 of the rules\tRatio of the decision\nThe inter se seniority of the direct recruits and promotees shall be determined in accordance with Rules 5,6 and 24 as per the judgment in K.C.Joshi case'.All the employees are entitled to all consequential benefits\tRatio of the decision\nLater when Raj Narayan Singh and others filed Writ Petition (Civil\tFacts\nNo.641 of 1991,this Court on June 6,1991 directed to convert the writ petition as a contempt case for non-implementation of the direction issued in K.C.Joshi case' which was numbered as Contempt Petition No.164 of 1971.When\tFacts\nit came up for hearing on August\tFacts\n23,1991,this Court observed thus : \"We are told by the counsel for the State of U.P.that for the purpose of working out the seniority draft list has been prepared and was in circulation inviting objections\tFacts\nThe petitioners therein had not filed any objection,despite giving time,but it was directed that the State would consider their cases even if they make any representation\tFacts\nIn the light of that stand while dismissing the contempt petition,this Court directed the Sate Government to dispose of the matter on the basis of the representation that may be received from the petitioners therein against the draft seniority list within six months from that date\tFacts\nIn these contempt petitions the promotees as well as some of the subsequent direct recruits complain against fixation of their inter se seniority by the State Government\tFacts\nShri R.K.Garg for the promotees contended that as on August 31,1982 selection of the promotees on regular basis to fill up the posts of Asstt\tArgument\nConservator,Forest for the years 1973-74 to 1979-80 had taken place by a regularly constituted selection committee which selected 140 candidates for appointment\tArgument\nTherefore,they are entitled to the seniority from the respective years\tArgument\nIt is also contended that the promotees are entitled,in terms of the judgment in K.C.Joshi case' for appointment by promotion to substantive vacancies within their quota in the respective years and that therefore,their seniority should be counted from the years in which they started discharging their duties as Asstt\tArgument\nConservators,Forest,as they were initially appointed to the substantive vacancies\tArgument\nShri Verma appearing for some of the later direct recruits,contended that the direct recruits were appointed to the substantive vacancies as held in K.C.Joshi case' and their seniority was fixed in the judgment from the date on which they started discharging the duties of the post as Asstt\tArgument\nConservators,Forest\tArgument\nTreating them to be temporary as shown in the seniority list prepared by the State is in utter contempt of the directions in Joshi case1\tArgument\nIn the rejoinder the promotees have stated that as on December 31,1974 a total number of 140 posts of Asstt\tRatio of the decision\nConservators,Forest were available and their quota as per the existing rules was 25 per cent\tRatio of the decision\nAs on December 1,1980,186 posts,namely,140 and 46 posts created during the period were available\tRatio of the decision\nAs per the ratio,the promotees are entitled to 33 1/3,per cent quota\tRatio of the decision\nAs on March 11,1985,32 more posts were created and the total posts available were 218.On\tRatio of the decision\nDecember 1,1986,40 more posts were created\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,as on March II,1985,the total posts available were\tRatio of the decision\n258.On March 1,1985,the quota was increased by 50 per cent\tRatio of the decision\nThe promotees,therefore,are entitled to 50 per cent of the posts\tRatio of the decision\nAs in the year 1990,72 more posts were created and the total posts are now 330.Therefore,they are entitled to 50 per cent of the quota in the tentative list\tRatio of the decision\nBut that was not done\tRatio of the decision\nThereby,the action of the State is in defiance of the direction issued by this Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn the counter-affidavit filed by the State it is stated that as on December 1,1980 both permanent and temporary posts were 131.As on February 12,1986,203 posts were existing\tArgument\nThe permanent posts are 102 and temporary posts are 173 and the total would come to 275.As per Rules 5 and 24 only permanent posts should be counted as substantive posts and temporary posts cannot be counted for fixation of the seniority\tArgument\nIt is further contended that though decision was taken to give 50 per cent quota to the promotees,the statutory rules have not been made\tArgument\nTherefore,they are entitled to only 33 1/3 per cent quota\tArgument\nSince the seniority,as per the direction of this Court,was made only to substantive posts,some of the direct recruits became temporary direct recruits and the seniority was determined accordingly\tArgument\nIn the light of the respective contentions,the question arises whether the determination of the seniority is in accordance with the directions issued by this Court\tArgument\nIn the light of the background scenario,we cannot strictly take it to be a case of contempt but in working out the directions issued by this Court,the State Government committed a mistake in law\tArgument\nWe have to consider,therefore,whether the procedure adopted by the Sate to determine the inter se seniority is in accordance with the rules and the law laid down in K.C Joshi case\tArgument\nThe directions issued in K.C Joshi case' have already been extracted and their need to reiterate is obviated\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the averments it would appear that 100 promotee Asstt\tRatio of the decision\nConservators,Forest are awaiting appointment to substantive vacancies\tRatio of the decision\nThe total number of direct recruits appears to be 215.Prior to December 31,1974,the quota was 75 per cent to the direct recruits and 25 per cent to the promotees\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly as on January 1,1975,the ratio was increased to 33 1/3 per cent,namely,66 2/3 per cent to the direct recruits and 33 1/3 per cent to the promotees\tRatio of the decision\nIndisputably a decision was taken on March 1,1975 to increase the quota to 50 per cent but no amendment to the statutory rules to give effect to it was made\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the operative rule as on that date appears to be 33 1/3 per cent in respect of promotees\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the procedure to be adopted by the State in fixing the inter se seniority of the direct recruits and the promotees in their respective quota is the sole question\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no rota prescribed in the rules\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the State is enjoined to implement the judgment of this Court in the light of the statutory rules\tRatio of the decision\nIt is clear from the counter-affidavit filed by the State that the posts are both permanent and temporary\tRatio of the decision\nIf the temporary posts are likely to continue for long,normally,as per the law laid down by this Court,they be treated,for the purpose of counting seniority,as permanent posts unless they are likely to be abolished\tRatio of the decision\nIt is a policy matter\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the State has to determine whether the posts are likely to be made permanent or abolished\tRatio of the decision\nIn the event of converting them as permanent under Rule 24,the quota prescribed in Rule 6 would be applied to substantive posts\tRatio of the decision\nThe seniority shall be determined in accordance with the quota rule to the posts available in the respective years in which the vacancies had arisen otherwise existing substantive posts should be filled up applying Rule 6.It is,therefore,incumbent upon the State Government to find out how many vacancies were existing in the year 1974-75 and thereafter every year and to determine as to how the respective posts stood reserved for the direct recruits and promotees in accordance with the quota\tRatio of the decision\nOn so determining,the direct recruits would go en block as seniors to the promotees and the promotee officers in the order of their inter se seniority be appointed by the Governor under Rule 5(b) read with Rule 6 and would be placed below the direct recruits\tRatio of the decision\nSimilar exercise for each year in which the substantive vacancies had arisen should be done\tRatio of the decision\nThe officers,he they direct recruits or promotees would rank below the juniormost officer in the list of the previous year\tRatio of the decision\nAfter this exercise is exhausted; appointments should be made; posts are to be filled up to substantive vacancies\tRatio of the decision\nIt would be open to the State Government to fix tentatively the inter se seniority in the temporary posts according to the ratio between the direct recruits and the promotees in the same manner of filling the substantive posts as indicated above\tRuling by Present Court\nAs and when the temporary posts are converted either into permanent posts or the vacancies arise due to superannuation of the senior officers,they should be fixed in the respective vacancies and fitment made\tRuling by Present Court\nAfter exhausting the exercise the remaining candidates awaiting appointment would continue to be temporary until they get due placement or fixation of their seniority\tRuling by Present Court\nThese directions would meet the exigencies\tRatio of the decision\nThe State Government is directed to undertake fresh exercise in the light of the above directions and complete the same within a period of four months from the date of the receipt of the order\tRuling by Present Court\nThe contempt petitions are accordingly disposed of\tRuling by Present Court\nPetition disposed of\tRuling by Present Court\n"

Sundaravardhan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant very forcefully submitted that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the order of acquittal passed in respect of the present appellant\tArgument\nHe submitted that although the incident in question had taken place at about 8.45 p.m. the same came to be reported to the police at 3.00 a.m\tArgument\nHe also submitted that the police officer (PW-21) who received the information about the incident started investigation without recording either any general diary (for short G.D.) entry or the FIR and, therefore, the FIR which has been proved in the trial court is hit by the provisions of S. 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short \"the CrPC\tArgument\nHe also submitted that the High Court has not given any reason for setting aside the appeal against acquittal which was passed after appreciating the entire evidence on record\tArgument\nHe further submitted that there was not only shifting of time of the alleged occurrence but also shifting of the place of occurrence from the hall to the outside verandah and courtyard to suit the convenience of the prosecution case\tArgument\nHe has drawn our attention towards the entire evidence on record including the cross-examination part and with the help of the same he submitted that the entire alleged incident in question had taken place when there was complete darkness at the scene of occurrence\tArgument\nA scuffle started between the nephew and the uncle in which the accused persons also received injuries and, therefore, the right of private defence of the appellant was available and in that view of the matter, the order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside\tArgument\nIt was further submitted that the alleged eye-witnesses of the occurrence were examined by the police belatedly and that the medical evidence adduced in the case does not in any manner support the ocular evidence and if at all it would not be a case of culpable homicide amounting to murder but a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder\tArgument\nHe also submitted that if two views are possible and if there are lacunae in the case of the prosecution, the benefit must go to the accused\tArgument\nHe next submitted that there was no evidence on record as to when the FIR reached the Magistrate and that none of the courts below considered the said aspect\tArgument\nHe submitted that since there was violation of the provisions of S. 162 of the CrPC, the accused-appellant is liable to be acquitted\tArgument\nMs. A. Subhashini, learned counsel appearing for the respondent- State, however, strenuously submitted that none of the aforesaid submissions could be accepted by this Court as it is a foolproof case of conviction of the appellant u/s\tArgument\n302 IPC\tRatio of the decision\nShe submitted that the High Court rightly interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the trial court after critically examining the evidence on record\tArgument\nIt was submitted by her that the trial court examined the evidence in the present case in a very summary and cryptic manner and thereby arrived at a wrong conclusion that the accused persons were required to be acquitted\tArgument\nShe has drawn our attention to the findings recorded by the High Court while setting aside the order of acquittal observing that the evidence of eye-witnesses namely PWs\tArgument\n1, 2, 8 and 18 is convincing and reliable but so far as the evidence of PW-4 is concerned, the High Court has made an observation that he is not a reliable witness\tArgument\nCounsel for the respondent has, therefore, taken us through the evidence of PWs\tArgument\n1, 2, 8 and 18 and on the basis thereof submitted that their evidence clearly prove and establish the role of the appellant herein in stabbing the deceased with the knife which he had brought from the other room with the intention of killing the deceased and, therefore, it is a clear case of conviction\tArgument\nu/s\tArgument\nIn the light of the aforesaid submissions of the counsel appearing for the parties we have given our in-depth consideration to the facts of the present case\tRatio of the decision\nThe starting point of the incident in question as indicated from the evidence on record is the hall where apparently a dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house\tRatio of the decision\nThe deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nAt this, the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also clear and established that thereafter a lamp was brought by Accused No. 3 to the room besides another lamp which was already burning in the said room itself\tRatio of the decision\nBut, in any case, there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house\tRatio of the decision\nThere is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place\tRatio of the decision\nThere was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which Accused No. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe said fact is proved by the evidence of PWs\tRatio of the decision\n2, 8, 18 and the complainant herself (PW-1\tRatio of the decision\nThe deceased was taken to the hospital and while so taken he died\tRatio of the decision\nPW-21 who was at that time attached to Konda Police Station as PSI was informed at about 10.45 p.m. that the deceased while was being brought in the police jeep by a police constable Jaisingrao Rane and was being taken to the Government Medical College but before the deceased could be admitted he died\tRatio of the decision\nPW-21 was also informed by said by said PSI K.K. Desai of Panaji Police Station that it was a case of assault and that the incident had taken place at verandah and that the said matter pertains to his police station and, therefore, he should take appropriate action\tRatio of the decision\nOn receiving the said message he went to the place of occurrence along with PSI K.K. Desai and upon reaching the place of occurrence at 11.30 p.m. he found the entire place plunged in total darkness\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, he proceeded to survey the place of occurrence with the help of torches\tRatio of the decision\nHe, in his deposition specifically stated that he found that the back door as well as the front door of the house were latched from inside and in front of the house there was a road where there was an electricity pole and there was a street tube light by which the house could be visible and even the lights of the vehicles were flashed at the house\tRatio of the decision\nHe stated that although the house had electricity connection, but was not having the electricity supply\tRatio of the decision\nHe gave instructions to his subordinate and also to the people around that nobody should touch any article lying at the scene of occurrence\tRatio of the decision\nHe stated that he made preliminary enquiry and brought Yashoda and her two daughters to the police station and sent two other officers in search of Accused Nos\tRatio of the decision\n1 and 2 who were not found in the house\tRatio of the decision\nHe also stated that he got the complaint registered at the police station which was lodged by PW-1 and that on the next day he again went to the scene of offence and seized the properties involved in the crime which were sealed\tRatio of the decision\nHe also recovered the knife at the instance of accused Sharmila which he seized\tRatio of the decision\nOn 28.04.1988, that is, after about 9 days of the incident, Accused Nos\tRatio of the decision\n1 and 2 surrendered before the police and on their surrender they were taken into custody\tRatio of the decision\nIt was found that Accused No. 1 was having injury on his back\tRatio of the decision\nand he was medically examined\tRatio of the decision\nOn medical examination his injury was found to be simple\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel appearing for the appellant was critical of the manner in which PW-21 initiated the investigation without recording any G.D. entry and without getting any FIR recorded\tArgument\nHe submitted that since the investigation in the instant case was started by the police without recording an FIR, such an FIR is necessarily hit by the provisions of S. 162 of the Cr\tArgument\nP.C\tArgument\nHe next submitted that no evidence having been led by the prosecution about the time when the FIR reached the Magistrate, therefore, there is also violation of the provisions of S. 157 of the Cr\tArgument\nThe issue with regard to the initiation of the investigation without recording the FIR was succinctly addressed by this Court in the case of State of U.P. v. Bhagwant Kishore Joshi, (1964) 3 SCR 71 1963 Indlaw SC 268, observed as follows: \"17\tPrecedent\nWhat is investigation is not defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure; but in H.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. State of Delhi 1954 Indlaw SC 14 this Court has described, the procedure, for investigation as follows: \"Thus, under the Code investigation consists generally of the following steps, (1) Proceeding to the spot, (2) Ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case, (3) Discovery and arrest of the suspected offender, (4) Collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of (a) the examination of various persons (including the accused) and the reduction of their statements into writing, if the officer thinks fit, (b) the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial, and (5) formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge-sheet u/s\tPrecedent\nThis Court, however, has not said that if a police officer takes merely one or two of the steps indicated by it, what he has done must necessarily be regarded as investigation\tPrecedent\nInvestigation, in substance, means collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence\tPrecedent\nThe Investigating Officer is, for this purpose, entitled to question persons who, in this opinion, are able to throw light on the offence which has been committed and is likewise entitled to question the suspect and is entitled to reduce the statements of persons questioned by him to writing\tPrecedent\nHe is also entitled to search the place of the offence and to search other places with the object of seizing articles connected with the offence\tPrecedent\nNo doubt, for this purpose he has to proceed to the spot where the offence was committed and do various other things\tPrecedent\nBut the main object of investigation being to bring home the offence to the offender the essential part of the duties of an investigating officer in this connection is, apart from arresting the offender, to collect all material necessary for establishing the accusation against the offender\tPrecedent\nMerely making some preliminary enquire upon receipt of information from an anonymous source or a source of doubtful reliability for checking up the correctness of the information does not amount to collection of evidence and so cannot be regarded as investigation\tPrecedent\nIn the absence of any prohibition in the Code, express or implied, I am of opinion that it is open to a police officer to make preliminary enquiries before registering an offence and making a full scale investigation into it\tPrecedent\nNo doubt, Section 5-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted for preventing harassment to a government servant and with this object in view investigation, except with the previous permission of a Magistrate, is not permitted to be made by an officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police\tPrecedent\nWhere, however, a police officer makes some preliminary enquiries, does not arrest or even question an accused or question any witnesses but merely makes a few discreet enquiries or looks at some documents without making any notes, it is difficult to visualise how any possible harassment or even embarrassment would result therefrom to the suspect or the accused person\tPrecedent\nIf no harassment to the accused results from the action of a police officer how can it be said to defeat the purpose underlying Section 5-A\tPrecedent\nLooking at the matter this way, I hold that what Mathur did was something very much short of investigation and, therefore, the provisions of Section 5-A were not violated\tPrecedent\nSince no irregularity was committed by him there is no occasion to invoke the aid of the curative provisions of the Code\tPrecedent\nemphasis underlined\tPrecedent\nIn the instant case, it is quite clear from the evidence on record that PW-1 received the information about the death of the deceased from PSI of Panaji Police Station without any detail as to how the incident had happened and who had caused the incident\tRatio of the decision\nIt was a very cryptic information received by him regarding the death of a person residing within the jurisdiction of his police station pursuant to an incident taking place on 10.04.1988 between 8.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. and, therefore, it appears that there was not enough information available to him either to get a G.D. entry recorded or to get an FIR lodged\tRatio of the decision\nIn order to verify the information received, PW-21 went to the place of occurrence and found the entire house in total darkness\tRatio of the decision\nHe went around the house and saw blood marks on the walls of the verandah and also in the courtyard and came to learn about the incident by using torch light\tRatio of the decision\nWhen he reached at the place of occurrence even the complainant party was not available there\tRatio of the decision\nbut at a later stage they came there\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, he brought them along with the residents of the house who were found to be there namely Accused No. 3 and the two juvenile offenders namely Sarita and Sharmila, who were all ladies\tRatio of the decision\nAfter reaching the police station and at the request of PW-1 the FIR was recorded at 3.00 a.m. in the morning\tRatio of the decision\nHe received the information about the incident on telephone at about 10.45 p.m. and reached the place of occurrence at about 11.30 p.m. and he must have been there for quite some time and thereafter returned to the police station which must have taken another about 1.30 to 2 hours\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, recording of the FIR at about 3.00 a.m. in the morning was justified and properly explained and it cannot be said that there was any delay in recording the FIR\tRatio of the decision\nBesides, the fact of his going to the place of occurrence would not amount to making an investigation\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence to show that at that point of time, PW-21 seized any articles or interrogated any witnesses or took any other action in initiating or in furtherance of investigation\tRatio of the decision\nThe ratio of the decision in Bhagwant Kishore Joshi 1963 Indlaw SC 268 (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case as the police officer merely visited the spot and place of occurrence and made some survey which cannot be regarded as investigation\tRatio of the decision\nIn Animireddy Venkata Ramana and Others v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of Andhra Pradesh, (2008) 5 SCC 368, 2008 Indlaw SC 354 , this Court while considering a similar case observed as follows: \" 10\tPrecedent\nCertain basic facts are not denied or disputed\tPrecedent\nThe deceased died in the bus at about 10.30 p.m. on 23-6-1998 while travelling to his village home from Tuni\tPrecedent\nPW 1 also sustained injuries in the said incident\tPrecedent\nImmediately after the incident, hearing cries of passengers, the driver of the bus stopped the bus\tPrecedent\nNot only the accused persons fled away, all others also did, including PWs 3 and 4\tPrecedent\nThey came back after a short while hearing the cries of PW 1\tPrecedent\nThey acceded to his request to take the bus to his house\tPrecedent\nFrom the records, it appears that the distance between the place where the accident took place and the village in question was not much\tPrecedent\nIn any event, the destination of the bus was the said village and they were bound to take the bus thereat\tPrecedent\nPW 1 informed about the incident to PW 2, another son of the deceased\tPrecedent\nThe dead body of the deceased was brought down from the bus and taken to the house\tPrecedent\nThe conductor of the bus sent an information to the Depot Manager of the State Road Transport Corporation at Tuni\tPrecedent\nThe investigating officer was also informed\tPrecedent\nA report to that effect might have been noted in the general diary but the same could not have been treated to be an FIR\tPrecedent\nWhen an information is received by an officer in charge of a police station, he in terms of the provisions of the Code was expected to reach the place of occurrence as early as possible\tPrecedent\nIt was not necessary for him to take that step only on the basis of a first information report\tPrecedent\nAn information received in regard to commission of a cognizable offence is not required to be preceded by a first information report\tPrecedent\nDuty of the State to protect the life of an injured as also an endeavour on the part of the responsible police officer to reach the place of occurrence in a situation of this nature is his implicit duty and responsibility\tPrecedent\nIf some incident had taken place in a bus, the officers of Road Transport Corporation also could not ignore the same\tPrecedent\nThey reached the place of occurrence in another bus at about 1 a.m\tPrecedent\nThe deceased and the injured were only then shifted to Tuni Hospital\tPrecedent\nThe ratio of the aforesaid decision is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case\tRatio of the decision\nEven assuming that PW-21, the Investigating Officer could have entered the aforesaid information received from PSI of Panaji Police Station in the general diary, yet they said entry could not have been held or treated to be an FIR\tRatio of the decision\nThe information received by him was very cryptic and without any detail about the incident in question and, therefore, in any case, there was no possibility of recording an FIR at that stage\tRatio of the decision\nThe place of occurrence was in total darkness and even the persons belonging to the complainant side were not available, therefore, bringing them to the police station where there was sufficient light and recording the complaint at 3.00 a.m. cannot, in any manner, cast any doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case\tRatio of the decision\nIn that view of the matter it cannot be said that the FIR was in any manner hit by the provisions of S. 162 of CrPC\tRatio of the decision\nSo far contention that there was violation of S. 157 of the CrPC is concerned, the same is also without any basis for the defence never cross-examined PW-21 on the aforesaid issue\tRatio of the decision\nSo long the defence is not able to establish from the records by cogent evidence that there was any delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate, it cannot be held that there was any such delay\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence on record before us to hold either way for no such issue was raised either before the trial court or before the High Court nor any evidence was led by the defence in respect of the said issue which is sought to be raised at this stage\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the evidence on record it does not appear to us that any suggestion was given to the said witness to the effect that the copy of the FIR was not sent or that it was dispatched late, which if given, would have given an opportunity to the witness to afford some explanation or to show as to when the FIR, was sent to and received by the Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nIn that view of the matter we do not agree with the counsel appearing for the appellant that delay in transmitting the FIR to the Magistrate stands proved in the present case\tRatio of the decision\nThe next contention that we proceed to discuss now is about whether sufficient light was available at the place of occurrence for the eye- witnesses to see the occurrence as stated by them in the evidence\tRatio of the decision\nWe have PWs\tRatio of the decision\n1, 2, 8 and 18 as eye-witnesses to the occurrence\tRatio of the decision\nThese eye-witnesses have stated that the incident had happened initially in the hall where there was some light for Accused No. 3 has brought a lamp to the hall and apart from that another lamp was also burning which was attached to the ceiling\tRatio of the decision\nBlood was found by the police on the wall of the verandah and in the courtyard\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also established from the evidence on record for it is clearly stated that the street light having tube light was giving sufficient light to the place of occurrence and that it was directed towards the house which was the place of occurrence\tRatio of the decision\nBesides, all the aforesaid eye-witnesses were inmates of the house and they would know as to who had given the blows for they specifically stated that initially the appellant did not have the knife in his hand but when the deceased and others went to the balcony then he went inside the house and brought a knife with which he gave stab injuries to the deceased which became fatal and as a result of which the deceased died while he was being taken to the hospital\tRatio of the decision\nThe aforesaid eye-witnesses, although, are related witnesses, were natural witnesses for they were the inmates of the house where the incident had taken place\tRatio of the decision\nThe said eye-witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nThe discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner affecting the substratum of the prosecution case and therefore, minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye-witnesses are immaterial\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court has observed as follows in the case of Dinesh Kumar v. State of Rajasthan, (2008) 8 SCC 270 2008 Indlaw SC 2034, : \"11\tPrecedent\nIt is to be noted that PWs 7 and 13 were the injured witnesses and PW 10 was another eyewitness and was the informant\tPrecedent\nLaw is fairly well settled that even if acquittal is recorded in respect of the co-accused on the ground that there were exaggerations and embellishments, yet conviction can be recorded if the evidence is found cogent, credible and truthful in respect of another accused\tPrecedent\nThe mere fact that the witnesses were related to the deceased cannot be a ground to discard their evidence\tPrecedent\nIn law, testimony of an injured witness is given importance\tPrecedent\nWhen the eyewitnesses are stated to be interested and inimically disposed towards the accused, it has to be noted that it would not be proper to conclude that they would shield the real culprit and rope in innocent persons\tPrecedent\nThe truth or otherwise of the evidence has to be weighed pragmatically\tPrecedent\nThe court would be required to analyse the evidence of related witnesses and those witnesses who are inimically disposed towards the accused\tPrecedent\nBut if after careful analysis and scrutiny of their evidence, the version given by the witnesses appears to be clear, cogent and credible, there is no reason to discard the same\tPrecedent\nConviction can be made on the basis of such evidence\tPrecedent\nThe aforesaid eye-witnesses were cross-examined at length but even after such lengthy cross-examination these eye-witnesses account could not be shaken\tRatio of the decision\nThe postmortem report indicates that there were sixteen injuries as against the two as adduced in ocular evidence and, therefore, a submission was made by the counsel appearing for the appellant that the medical evidence adduced in the present case is not supporting the ocular evidence\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, a perusal of record clearly shows that the doctor who conducted the postmortem (PW-7) stated in his evidence that there were in total 16 injuries when external examination was done by him and the knife M. O. 11 could have caused the injuries no. 1, 2, 3 and 4\tRatio of the decision\nHe further stated that the death was caused due to hemorrhage and shock as a result of stab injury\tRatio of the decision\nHe further stated that Injury No. 1 was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tRatio of the decision\nOn being cross-examined, PW-7 categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of Injury No. 1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no doubt that four injuries are indicated in the postmortem report shown to have been received by the deceased but the fact that the deceased was given stab injuries by the appellant with the help of a knife brought by him from inside the house is clearly established from the ocular evidence\tRatio of the decision\nThere is therefore one particular injury, being injury No. 1 caused because of stabbing and the rest being superficial in nature could be caused during scuffle\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, the alleged discrepancy cannot be said to be very vital as it has been held by this Court in several decisions that ocular evidence cannot be brushed aside only because, to some extent, it is not in consonance with the medical evidence\tRatio of the decision\nReference in this regard may be made to the decision of this Court in State of U. P. v. Krishna Gopal, (1988) 4 SCC 302; 1988 Indlaw SC 76 Anwar v. State of Haryana, (1997) 9 SCC 766; 1997 Indlaw SC 2447 Ravi Kumar v. State of Punjab, (2005) 9 SCC 315 2005 Indlaw SC 170; Munivel v. State of T.N., (2006) 9 SCC 394 2006 Indlaw SC 118\tRatio of the decision\nAll the contentions raised by learned counsel appearing for the appellant were considered by us in the light of evidence on record\tRatio of the decision\nand we find that none of the aforesaid submissions has any basis\tRatio of the decision\nThere is cogent and reliable evidence on record to prove and establish that the accused has committed the act of stabbing as a result of which the deceased had died\tRatio of the decision\nBefore dwelling further into the factual matrix of the case on the basis of which the High Court convicted the appellant u/s\tRatio of the decision\n302 IPC; it would be useful to briefly recapitulate the law on the point\tRatio of the decision\nS. 299 and S. 300 IPC deals with the definition of culpable homicide and murder respectively\tStatute\nS. 299 defines culpable homicide as the act of causing death; (i) with the intention of causing death or (ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or (iii) with the knowledge that such act is likely to cause death\tStatute\nThe bare reading of the section makes it crystal clear that the first and the second clause of the section refer to intention apart from the knowledge and the third clause refers to knowledge alone and not intention\tStatute\nBoth the expression \"intent\" and \"knowledge\" postulate the existence of a positive mental attitude which is of different degrees\tStatute\nThe mental element in culpable homicide i.e. mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge\tStatute\nIf that is caused in any of the aforesaid three circumstances, the offence of culpable homicide is said to have been committed\tStatute\nS. 300 IPC, however, deals with murder although there is no clear definition of murder provided in S. 300 IPC\tStatute\nIt has been repeatedly held by this Court that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is species and that all murders are culpable homicide but not vice versa\tStatute\nS. 300 IPC further provides for the exceptions which will constitute culpable homicide not amounting to murder and punishable u/s\tStatute\nWhen and if there is intent and knowledge then the same would be a case of S. 304\tStatute\nPart\tStatute\nI and if it is only a case of knowledge and not the intention to cause murder and bodily injury, then the same would be a case of S. 304 Part II\tStatute\nThe aforesaid distinction between an act amounting to murder and an act not amounting to murder has been brought out in the numerous decisions of this Court\tStatute\nIn the case of State of A.P. v. Rayavarapu Punnayya, (1976) 4 SCC 382, 1976 Indlaw SC 192 this Court observed as follows at page 386: \"12\tPrecedent\nIn the scheme of the Penal Code, \"culpable homicides\" is genus and \"murder\" its specie\tPrecedent\nAll \"murder\" is \"culpable homicide\" but not vice-versa\tPrecedent\nSpeaking generally, \"culpable homicide\" sans \"special characteristics of murder\", is \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\tPrecedent\nFor the purpose of fixing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic offence, the Code practically recognises three degrees of culpable homicide\tPrecedent\nThe first is, what may be called, \"culpable homicide of the first degree\tPrecedent\nThis is the greatest form of culpable homicide, which is defined in S. 300 as \"murder\tPrecedent\nThe second may be termed as \"culpable homicide of the second degree\tPrecedent\nThis is punishable under the first part of S. 304\tPrecedent\nThen, there is \"culpable homicide of the third degree\tPrecedent\nThis is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is, also, the lowest among the punishments provided for the three grades\tPrecedent\nCulpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the second part of S. 304\tPrecedent\nPlacing strong reliance on the aforesaid decision, this Court in the case of Abdul Waheed Khan v. State of A.P., (2002) 7 SCC 175 2002 Indlaw SC 1777, observed as follows at page 184: \"13\tPrecedent\nCl\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 corresponds with cls\tPrecedent\n2) and (3) of S. 300\tPrecedent\nThe distinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite u/cl\tPrecedent\n2) is the knowledge possessed by the offender regarding the particular victim being in such a peculiar condition or state of health that the internal harm caused to him is likely to be fatal, notwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be sufficient to cause death of a person in normal health or condition\tPrecedent\nIt is noteworthy that the \"intention to cause death\" is not an essential requirement of cl\tPrecedent\nOnly the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim, is sufficient to bring the killing within the ambit of this clause\tPrecedent\nThis aspect of cl\tPrecedent\n2) is borne out by Illustration (b) appended to S. 300\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 does not postulate any such knowledge on the part of the offender\tPrecedent\nInstances of cases falling u/cl\tPrecedent\n2) of S. 300 can be where the assailant causes death by a fist-blow intentionally given knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged liver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is likely to cause death of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be\tPrecedent\nIf the assailant had no such knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an intention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence will not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death, was intentionally given\tPrecedent\nIn cl\tPrecedent\n3) of Section 300, instead of the words \"likely to cause death\" occurring in the corresponding cl\tPrecedent\nb) of Section 299, the words \"sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\" have been used\tPrecedent\nObviously, the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\tPrecedent\nThe distinction is fine but real and if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice\tPrecedent\nThe difference between cl\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 and cl\tPrecedent\n3) of S. 300 is one of degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury\tPrecedent\nTo put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree\tPrecedent\nThe word \"likely\" in cl\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 conveys the sense of probable as distinguished from a mere possibility\tPrecedent\nThe words \"bodily injury ... sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\" mean that death will be the \"most probable\" result of the injury, having regard to the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nFor cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nRajwant Singh v. State of Kerala is an apt illustration of this point\tPrecedent\nIn Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab4\tPrecedent\n1958 Indlaw SC 82 Vivian Bose, J. speaking for the Court, explained the meaning and scope of cl\tPrecedent\nIt was observed that the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under S. 300 \"thirdly\tPrecedent\nFirst, it must establish quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved\tPrecedent\nThese are purely objective investigations\tPrecedent\nThirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional or that some other kind of injury was intended\tPrecedent\nOnce these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further, and fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nThis part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender\tPrecedent\nThe ingredients of clause \"thirdly\" of S. 300 IPC were brought out by the illustrious Judge in his terse language as follows: \"12\tPrecedent\nTo put it shortly, the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under S. 300 'thirdly'; First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely objective investigations\tPrecedent\nThirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended\tPrecedent\nOnce these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further and, Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nThe learned Judge explained the third ingredient in the following words \"The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present\tPrecedent\nIf he can show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such an inference, then, of course, the intent that the section requires is not proved\tPrecedent\nBut if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to inflict it\tPrecedent\nWhether he knew of its seriousness, or intended serious consequences, is neither here nor there\tPrecedent\nThe question, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness, but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion\tPrecedent\nThese observations of Vivian Bose, J. have become locus classicus\tPrecedent\nThe test laid down by Virsa Singh case4 for the applicability of clause \"thirdly\" is now ingrained in our legal system and has become part of the rule of law\tPrecedent\nUnder clause thirdly of S. 300 IPC, culpable homicide is murder, if both the following conditions are satisfied i.e. (a) that the act which causes death is done with the intention of causing death or is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury; and (b) that the injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\tPrecedent\nIt must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury which, in the ordinary course of nature, was sufficient to cause death viz\tPrecedent\nthat the injury found to be present was the injury that was intended to be inflicted\tPrecedent\nThus, according to the rule laid down in Virsa Singh case4 even if the intention of the accused was limited to the infliction of a bodily injury sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, and did not extend to the intention of causing death, the offence would be murder\tPrecedent\nIllustration (c) appended to S. 300 clearly brings out this point\tPrecedent\nc) of S. 299 and cl\tPrecedent\n4) of S. 300 both require knowledge of the probability of the act causing death\tPrecedent\nIt is not necessary for the purpose of this case to dilate much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses\tPrecedent\nIt will be sufficient to say that cl\tPrecedent\n4) of S. 300 would be applicable where the knowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of a person or persons in general as distinguished from a particular person or persons -- being caused from his imminently dangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty\tPrecedent\nSuch knowledge on the part of the offender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act having been committed by the offender without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid\tPrecedent\nThe above are only broad guidelines and not cast-iron imperatives\tPrecedent\nIn most cases, their observance will facilitate the task of the court\tPrecedent\nBut sometimes the facts are so intertwined and the second and the third stages so telescoped into each, that it may not be convenient to give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the second and third stages\tPrecedent\nThe aforesaid principles have been consistently followed by this Court in several decisions\tPrecedent\nReference in this regard may be made to the decision of this Court in Ruli Ram v. State of Haryana, (2002) 7 SCC 691 2002 Indlaw SC 1927; Augustine Saldanha v. State of Karnataka, (2003) 10 SCC 472; 2003 Indlaw SC 674 State of U. P. v.

State of Maharasthra, (2005) 9 SCC 71; 2004 Indlaw SC 268 and Jagriti Devi v. State of H. P., JT 2009 (8) SC 648\tPrecedent\n2009 Indlaw SC 859\tPrecedent\nThat being the well settled legal position, when we test the factual background of the present case on the principles laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions, we are unable to agree with the views taken by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nAs already noted, it is quite clear from the record that there was an altercation preceding the incident\tRatio of the decision\nThe place of occurrence is a residence inhabited by both the parties and there is no evidence on record that the deceased was armed with any weapon\tRatio of the decision\nInitially the accused-appellant also did not have any weapon with him but during the course of the incident he went inside and got a knife with the help of which he stabbed the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nPW-7\tRatio of the decision\nin his cross examination has categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of Injury No. 1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature\tRatio of the decision\nSo, it was only Injury No. 1 which was fatal in nature\tRatio of the decision\nFactually therefore, there was only one main injury caused due to stabbing and that also was given on the back side of the deceased and therefore, it cannot be said that there was any intention to kill or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness\tRatio of the decision\nRecords clearly establish that there was indeed a scuffle between the parties with regard to the availability of electricity in a particular room and during the course of scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place\tRatio of the decision\nThere is, therefore, provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the moment\tRatio of the decision\nThat being the factual position, we are of the considered view that the present case cannot be said to be a case u/s\tRatio of the decision\nbut it is a case falling under S. 304 Part II IPC\tRatio of the decision\nIt is trite law that S. 304 Part II comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death\tRatio of the decision\nAccordingly, we convict the appellant under Section 304, Part II of IPC and sentence him to undergo imprisonment for a period of 7 years\tRuling by Present Court\nHis bail bonds shall stand cancelled and the appellant shall surrender immediately to serve out the remaining period of sentence\tRuling by Present Court\nIf, however, the appellant does not surrender by himself, the State shall take necessary steps to rearrest him to undergo the remaining part of sentence\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeal stands disposed of in terms of aforesaid order\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal disposed of\tRuling by Present Court\n"

decision\nThere is a third partnership deed Exhibit-70 which showed that the deceased tenant Girdharlal had died on 1st of February,1961 and so by the remaining seven partners with same terms and conditions,a new partnership deed being Exhibit-70 was executed on 22nd\tRatio of the decision\nSeptember,1961.At this time the share of the appellant was fixed at 0.03 paise in a rupee to share the profits only\tRatio of the decision\nIn 1965 some partners retired and the remaining four partners executed a fresh partnership deed Exhibit-117 on 1st\tFacts\nApril,1965.This last partnership deed was executed by the appellant and original defendants\tFacts\nNos.3,4 and 5\tFacts\nThe main question in issue in this appeal as well as before the High Court in revision was whether there was a genuine partnership at the appellant was a partner\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that since after 4th of October,1960 the partnership firm was carrying on business in the premises in question\tRatio of the decision\nIt is well settled that if there was such a partnership firm of which the appellant was a partner as a tenant the same would not amount to subletting leading to the forfeiture of the tenancy\tRatio of the decision\nFor this proposition see the decision of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Mehta Jagjivan Vanechand v\tRatio of the decision\nDoshi Vanechand Harakhchand and others\tRatio of the decision\nA.I.R.1972 Gujarat 6 1970 Indlaw GUJ 68.Thakkar,J.of the Gujarat High Court,as the learned Judge then was,held that the mere fact that a tenant entered into a partnership and allowed the premises being used for the benefit of partnership does not constitute assignment or subletting in favour of the partnership firm entitling a landlord to recover possession\tRatio of the decision\nThis view is now concluded by the decision of this Court in Madras Bangalore Transport Co.(West) v\tRatio of the decision\nInder Singh and others,[1986] 3 S.C.C.62 1986\tRatio of the decision\nIndlaw SC 748\tRatio of the decision\nThe trial court in the instant appeal held that there was subletting\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt accordingly decreed the suit for possession instituted by the landlord\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe suit,inter alia,was filed by the landlord on the ground of subletting\tFacts\nThere was an appeal before the Court of Small Causes,Bombay and by judgment and order delivered by the Court of Small Causes,Bombay on 18th of August,1977,it was held that the learned Trial Judge had erred in passing a decree for possession on the ground of subletting,change of user and breach of terms of tenancy\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn the premises,the appeal was allowed\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt may be mentioned that the respondent No.1 is the landlord of two premises which were quite adjacent as mentioned before\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent-plaintiff had alleged in both the suits that the appellant was his tenant in the suit premises which were leased to him for conducting his business in the name of Ahmedabad Fine\tFacts\nWeaving Works,and according to the terms of tenancy suit,the suit premises were leased for manufacturing cloth in the name of Ahmedabad Fine & Weaving Works\tFacts\nThe landlord had alleged that the appellant had closed that business and he was not using the premises in question for the purpose for which it was let to him\tFacts\nIt was further alleged by the landlord that the appellant had unlawfully sublet the major part of the premises in question of both the suits to defendant Nos.2 to 5 in the original suit and these defendants were running business in partnership for manufacturing of neon signs in the name of Bharat Neon Signs\tFacts\nIt was further alleged that the appellant had also unlawfully sublet one room of the suit premises to defendant No.6 in Suit No.553 of 1969 who was residing in that room\tFacts\nFor the purpose of the Suit No.553 of 1969 with which the appeal is concerned,it is relevant to state that the appellant had raised the contention that Ahmedabad Fine & Weaving Works was not the tenant of the suit premies but the suit premises was tenanted by the father of the appellant Girdharlal Chimalal in 1938 and he was the original tenant of the premises and appellant subsequently joined the business of his father as a partner and the name of the partnership firm was Ahmedabad Fine Weaving Works\tRatio of the decision\nHe has stated further that the suit premises were to be used for business and he could use it for any business and he joined in partnership with Defendants Nos.2 to 5 somewhere in 1961 to prepare neon signs and the defendants Nos.2 to 5 were his partners and doing business in the suit premises\tArgument\nHe contended further that the suit premises was with him and the defendants Nos.2 to 5 had not acquired any tenancy rights in the suit premises\tArgument\nIt is further stated that he had filed a civil suit to dissolve the partnership and to take account and his suit was pending in City Civil Court\tArgument\nIt may be mentioned that by the time the revision petition came to be decided by the High Court the suit had been decreed in his favour directing a dissolution of the said partnership and directing taking of the accounts\tRatio of the decision\nThere was an appeal filed from that decree and that appeal was also dismissed and disposed of affirming the decree for the dissolution of the partnership,inter se between the parties being the partners of the said firm\tFacts\nThese facts were accepted that there was a partnership\tFacts\nAs mentioned hereinbefore the learned trial Judge consolidated both the suits and in the instant suit being No.553 of 1969 with which this appeal is concerned,it was held by the learned trial Judge that there was unlawful subletting\tRuling by Lower Court\nThere was a decree for possession\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis was set aside in appeal\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellate Court so far as the material for the present appeal is concerned held that there was no subletting and there was only carrying on of the business in partnership with defendants Nos.2 to 5 in the name of Bharat Neon Signs\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the first question that had to be decided by the Appellate Court being the Court of Small Causes,Bombay and if a revision lay before the High court was whether there was any genuine partnership\tRatio of the decision\nThe partnership deeds were there,the appellant was not to share in the losses\tRatio of the decision\nThe Court of Small Causes came to the conclusion on an analysis of the evidence before it and the terms of the three partnership deeds referred to hereinbefore that there was a genuine partnership in law which was acted upon\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court in revision reversed that finding\tRatio of the decision\nThe first question therefore,is,whether the High Court could do so in the facts of this case and secondly whether the High Court was right in so doing\tRatio of the decision\nWhether there was a partnership or not may in certain cases be a mixed question of law and fact,in the sense that whether the ingredients of partnership as embodied in the law of partnership were there in.a particular case or not must be judged in the light of the principles applicable to partnership\tRatio of the decision\nThe first question,therefore,is what is a partnership\tRatio of the decision\nThat has to be found in section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act,1932,it says \"Partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all\" (Emphasis supplied\tRatio of the decision\nSection 6 of the said Act reiterates that in determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm,or whether a person is or is not a partner in a firm,regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties,as shown by all relevant facts taken together\tRatio of the decision\nThe following important elements must be there in order to establish partnership,(1) there must be an agreement entered into by all parties concerned,(2\tRatio of the decision\nthe agreement must be to share profits of business; and (3) the business must be carried on by all or any of the persons concerned acting for all\tRatio of the decision\nThe partnership deeds were there entitling the petitioner to share in the partnership\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that in the partnership deeds the bank accounts were not to be operated by the appellant,and further that irrespective of the profit\tRatio of the decision\nthe clause of the partnership deed provided that there should be a fixed percentage of profit to be given to the partner-appellant No.1.The appellant was not to share the losses\tRatio of the decision\nBut there is nothing illegal about it\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant was to bring his asset being the tenancy of the premises in question for the user of the partnership\tRatio of the decision\nAll these tests were borne in mind by the Court of Small Causes,Bombay in the appeal from the decision of the learned trial Judge\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellate Court had considered the partnership deeds\tRatio of the decision\nOne point was emphasised by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nMehta,learned counsel appearing for the respondents,that the original first partnership deed did not mention the appellant or his father as a partner\tRatio of the decision\nIt was in the second partnership deed that the appellant and his father joined the firm\tRatio of the decision\nThe firm started as emphasised by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nMehta on 4th of October,1960 and it was only on the 24th of October,1960 the second partnership deed was -executed\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,it was emphasised that there was a gap of time when there was user by the partnership firm of the premises in question when the appellant was not a member of the firm\tRatio of the decision\nIt was emphasised that this aspect was not considered by the Court of Small Causes and the High Court,therefore,was justified in interfering with the findings of the Court of Small Causes\tRatio of the decision\nWe are unable to agree\tRatio of the decision\nThese deeds were there,the partners were crossexamined,there was no specific evidence as to from what date the firm started functioning from the particular premises in question\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly,it was emphasised by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nMehta that the partnership deed was a camouflage\tRatio of the decision\nIt is evident from the sales-tax registration and other registration certificates and licences under the Shops and Establishments Act that the partnership was registered in the name of the appellant and the appellant was also indicated as a partner\tRatio of the decision\nIt was so in the Income Tax returns and assessments\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,it was submitted that the Court of Small Causes committed an error of law resulting in miscarriage of justice\tRatio of the decision\nIt was submitted by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nMehta that once it was accepted that the partnership deed was a mere camouflage the other subsequent acts and conducts were merely ancillary and were put in a formal way\tRatio of the decision\nBut the question is from the three deeds itself which were examined in detail by the Court of Small Causes and which were re-examined by the High Court could it be said unequivocally that there was no partnership\tRatio of the decision\nThe deeds gave the appellant the right to share the profits and made him agent for certain limited purposes of the firm and there was evidence that the partnership deeds were acted upon\tRatio of the decision\nThere was evidence of suit of dissolution of the partnership where none of the partners took the plea that it was a false or a fictitious document\tRatio of the decision\nThough the decree in the dissolution suit was not binding in these proceedings,inter se between the parties as partners it is a piece of evidence which cannot be wholly ignored\tRatio of the decision\nAll these factors were present before the Court of Small Causes\tRatio of the decision\nThese were reappraised by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nMehta\tRatio of the decision\nthat in the partnership deed which is not necessary to recite the terms,the petitioner was completely excluded in operating the bank accounts etc\tRatio of the decision\nThere is nothing inherently illegal or improbable making a provision of such a type\tRatio of the decision\nIn the eye of law,such a clause is really non-sequitur or neutral proving neither the existence nor non-existence of a genuine firm\tRatio of the decision\nThe first partnership deed which is Exhibit-114 is dated 13th October,1960.It recited that the partnership firm should be presently started at Ahmedabad and the same should later be started in another city\tRatio of the decision\nIn this the appellant was not a partner.Exhibit-69 at page 136 of Volume-II of the paper-book is a partnership deed wherein Girdharlal the father of the Appellant No.1 and the appellant No.1 joined as partners\tRatio of the decision\nIt recited that the partnership started from 4th of October,1960 at Ahmedabad\tRatio of the decision\nIt was registered in the name of 7th and 8th partners,Girdharlal who was the appellant and his father\tRatio of the decision\nIt was recited that the work of the partnership would be done by the parties of the fourth,fifth,sixth,seventh and eighth as per advice and instructions of the first,second and third\tRatio of the decision\nAll the work had been done by some of the partners of which appellants were not parties and that they had to do the said work as per instructions of the other partners\tRatio of the decision\nClauses 6 and 7 of the said partnership deed recited inter alia as follows: \"6.The year of accounts of our partnership shall be Aso Vadi 30th day i.e\tRatio of the decision\nDiwali and the first account year is decided to be the Aso Vadi 30th day of Samvat Year 2017.While settling accounts at the close of the year,33% amount from the sum which may remain as net profit after deducting all expenditures,viz interest,discount,rent of the shop,rent of the godown,insurance,brokerage,travelling,telegrams,postage,salaries of employees,etc.shall be carried to Reserve Fund and thereafter,in the sum that remains as net profit,the shares of us the partners have been fixed as under: 7.While settling accounts at the close of the year,if the sum less than Rs.1500 falls to the 0-03 shares of the partners of the seventh and eighth parts,the amount falling short has to be debited towards the head of expenditure and Rs.1500 (fifteen hundred only) have to be paid in full to each of them two,and in those circumstances or if there be loss,the parties of the seventh or eighth parts have not been held liable therefore; and in the year or' losses,it has been decided to pay Rs.1500 (fifteen hundred only) to each of them,after debiting the same towards the head of expenditure and in the year of losses nothing has to be carried to the 'Reserve Fund' and the loss has to be borne by us to parties first to sixth parts in the following proportion: 8.Clause 8 empowered the operating of the bank accounts by partners other than the appellant and his father\tRatio of the decision\nWe find intrinsically nothing improbable\tRatio of the decision\nIt is embodied in the deeds the functioning of the partnership\tRatio of the decision\nThe third partnership which is dated 22nd of September,1961 also indicates as parties of sixth part the name of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe relevant portion of the partnership deed reads as follows: \"To wit,the parties of the first to sixth parts out of us,deceased Khristi Girdharbhai Chimanlal and Shah Virchand Keshavji had jointly started the business of manufacturing and selling Neon Signs Tubes,in partnership in Ahmedabad from 4.10.1960,in the name and style of Bharat Neon Signs\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,on account of the death of Khristi Girdharbhai Chimanlal on 1.2.61 and other reasons,the said partnership was dissolved from 8.9.61.Thereafter,we the parties from the first to seventh part have,after purchasing at its cost price,all the debts and dues,goods,stock etc.,together with goodwill of the dissolved partnership,started manufacturing and selling of Neon Signs Tubes in partnership from 9.9.61.We,the parties of all the seven parts execute the deed of the said partnership to-day\tRatio of the decision\ni.e.22.9.61.The terms and conditions\tRatio of the decision\nthereof are as under\tRatio of the decision\n1) The entire work of our partnership has to be carried out in the name of \"Bharat Neon Signs\tRatio of the decision\n2) The work to be carried out by our partnership is of manufacturing and selling Neon Signs Tubes and of obtaining orders therefore\tRatio of the decision\n3) Whatever moneys that may be required to be invested in our partnership,are to be invested by the parties of the first,second,third,fourth and seventh parts out of us and the interest at the rate of 71/2 per cent per annum has to be paid for the moneys that may be invested in this partnership\tRatio of the decision\nWe are of the opinion that these were evidence that these terms were acted upon\tRatio of the decision\nThere was nothing intrinsically wrong in law in constituting a partnership in the manner it was done\tRatio of the decision\nIt was contended by Mr\tArgument\nMehta that there was no agency; reading the partnership deeds as we have read that conclusion does not emanate from position appearing debiting the fixed amount payable to the appellant in the expenses account which also is not inconsistent with partnership\tArgument\nThis is also not inconsistent with treating the rent of the firm in the context of the total expenditure of the firm\tRatio of the decision\nIn any event all these factors were considered by the Court of Small Causes bearing in mind the correct legal principles\tFacts\nThe High Court on a reappraisal of these very evidence came to the conclusion that the partnerships were camouflages and were not acted upon and in fact and in reality the partnership firm was a sub-tenant of the appellant herein\tFacts\nThe question is,can the High Court do so in law\tRatio of the decision\nThe power of the High Court to revise the order is contained in section 29(2) of the Bombay Rent Act as applicable at the relevant time to Gujarat,The said provision reads as follows: \"29(2\tStatute\nno further appeal shall lie against any decision in appeal under sub-section (1) but the High Court may,for the purpose of satisfying itself that any such decision in appeal was according to law,call for the case in which such decision was taken and pass such order with respect thereto as it thinks fit\tStatute\nThe ambit and power of revision generally and in particular with respect to the provisions with which we are concerned have from time to time come up for consideration by this Court\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court in Hari Shankar v\tRatio of the decision\nRao Girdhari Lal Chowdhury,[1962] 1 Suppl\tRatio of the decision\nSCR.933 1961 Indlaw SC 157 had to consider section 35(1) of the Delhi & Ajmer Rent Corntrol Act,1952\tRatio of the decision\nThe said section reads as follows:- \"35(1\tStatute\nThe High Court may,at any time,call for the record of any case under this Act for the purpose of satisfying itself that a decision made therein is according to law and may pass such order in relation thereto as it thinks fit\tStatute\nIt was held in the majority judgment by HidayatuIIah,J.as the learned Chief Justice then was,that though section 35 of the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act was worded in general terms but it did not create a right to have the case re-heard\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court emphasised that the distinction between an appeal and revision is a real one\tRatio of the decision\nA right to appeal carries with it right of re-heating on law as well as fact\tRatio of the decision\nunless the statute conferring the right to appeal limits the re-hearing in some way\tRatio of the decision\nThe power to hear a revision is generally given to a superior court so that it may satisfy itself that a particular case is decided according to law\tRatio of the decision\nThe expression \"according to law\" in section 35 of the said Act referred to the decision as a whole,and was not to be equated to errors of law or of fact simpliciter\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court was of the view that what the High Court could see is that there has been no miscarriage of justice and that the decision was according to law in the sense mentioned\tRatio of the decision\nKapur,J.who delivered a separate judgment,however,observed that the power under section 35(1) of the said Act of interference by the High Court is not restricted to a proper trial according to law or error in regard to onus of proof or proper opportunity of being heard\tRatio of the decision\nIt is very much wider than that,when in the opinion of the High Court the decision is erroneous on the question of law which affects the merits of the case or decision was manifestly unjust the High Court is entitled to interfere\tRatio of the decision\nThe revisional authority could ensure that there was no miscarriage of justice and the principles of law have been correctly borne in mind,the facts had been properly comprehended in that light\tRatio of the decision\nIf that was done in a particular case then the fact that the revisional authority or the High Court might have arrived to a different conclusion is irrelevant\tRatio of the decision\nThis view had also been expressed in the decision of this Court in Puranchand v\tRatio of the decision\nMotilal,[1963]\tRatio of the decision\nSupp.2 S.C.R.906 1962 Indlaw SC 455\tRatio of the decision\nThis principle was reiterated in Krishnawati v\tPrecedent\nHans Raj,[1974] 2 S.C.R.524 1973 Indlaw SC 208 which was dealing with section 39(2) of the Delhi Rent Control Act,1958 in second appeal\tPrecedent\nIt was observed that under section 39(2) of the said Act,the High Court could interfere in second appeal only if there was a substantial question of law\tPrecedent\nIn that case,the question whether the appellant was legally married no finding was necessary in the eviction suit\tPrecedent\nIt was sufficient for the rent court to proceed on the finding that the appellant and S were living together as husband and wife,whether they were legally married or not\tPrecedent\nIt was further held that whether there was subletting was not a mixed question of law and fact\tPrecedent\nIn Phiroze Bamanji Desai v\tPrecedent\nChandrakant M.Patel & Ors.,[1974] 3 SCR 267 1974 Indlaw SC 282 the question involved was whether there was reasonable and bona fide requirement of premises for personal use and occupation as also the question of greater hardship under the Bombay Rent Act and the ambit and scope of the power of Section 29(3) of the said Act with which we are concerned came up for consideration\tPrecedent\nBhagwati,J.as\tPrecedent\nthe learned Chief Justice then was,referred with approval the observations of Hidayatullah,J.referred to hereinbefore in Hari Shankar's case\tPrecedent\n1961 Indlaw SC 157 (supra).Bhagwati,J.observed that the ambit of section 35(1) of the Delhi & Ajmer Rent Control Act which fell for consideration in Hari Shanker's case 1961 Indlaw SC 157 (supra) was the same as section 29(3) of the  Bombay Rent Act and therefore,he expressed the opinion that the High Court could interfere only if there was miscarriage of justice due to mistake of law\tPrecedent\nWe must take note of a decision in the case of M/s Kasturbhai Ramchand Panchal & Brothers and Others v\tPrecedent\nFirm of Mohanlal Nathubhai and Others,AIR 1969 Gujarat 110 1967 Indlaw GUJ 57,upon which the High Court had placed great reliance in the judgment under appeal\tPrecedent\nThere the learned judge relying on section 29(2) of the said Act held that the revisional power with which the High Court was vested under section 29(2) was not merely in the nature of jurisdictional control\tPrecedent\nIt extended to corrections of all errors which would make the decision contrary to law\tPrecedent\nThe legislature,the learned Judge,felt,further empowered High Court in its revisional jurisdiction to pass such order with respect thereto as it thought fit\tPrecedent\nThe power according to the learned Judge was of the widest amplitude to pass such orders as the Court thought fit in order to do complete justice\tPrecedent\nHe dealt with the human problem under section 13(2) of Bombay Rent Act considering the relative hardships of the landlord and the tenant and to arrive at a just solution he was of the opinion that the court should have such wide field\tPrecedent\nThe jurisdiction of High Court is to correct all errors of law going to the root of the decision which would,in such cases,include even perverse findings of facts,perverse in the sense that no reasonable person,acting judicially and properly instructed in the relevant law could arrive at such a finding on the evidence on the record\tRatio of the decision\nIn this view in our opinion the ambit of the power was expressed in rather wide amplitude\tRatio of the decision\nAs we read the power,the High Court must ensure that the principles of law have been correctly borne in mind\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly,the facts have been properly appreciated and a decision arrived at taking all material and relevant facts in mind\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be such a decision which no reasonable man could have arrived at\tRatio of the decision\nLastly,such a decision does not lead to a miscarriage of justice\tRatio of the decision\nWe must,however,guard ourselves against permitting in the guise of revision substitution of one view where two views are possible and the Court of Small Causes has taken a particular view\tRatio of the decision\nIf a possible view has been taken,the High Court would be exceeding its jurisdiction to substitute its own view with that the courts below because it considers it to be a better view\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that the High Court would have taken a different view is wholly irrelevant\tRatio of the decision\nJudged by that standard,we are of the opinion that the High Court in this case had exceeded its jurisdiction\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of Punamchandra Revashankar Joshi v\tPrecedent\nRamjibhai Maganlal,Gujarat Law Reporter\tPrecedent\n1966),the Gujarat High Court after dealing with the Gujarat Amendment Act (XVIII) of 1965 observed that the Legislature has not intended to equate the ambit of the power with the one exercised in an appeal\tPrecedent\nThe authority vested in the High Court under the amendment still remained only in the domain of the jurisdiction and power of revision and no further\tRatio of the decision\nThe amending provision,therefore,only related to procedure and not to any rights of the parties\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court in the case of Bhai Chand Ratanshi v\tPrecedent\nLaxmishanker Tribhavan,[1982] 1 Rent Control Journal 2421981\tPrecedent\nIndlaw SC 244 observed that where lower courts applied their minds properly in deciding a matter under section 13(2) of the Bombay Rent Act,the High Court could not substitute its own finding for the one reached by the courts below,on a reappraisal of evidence under section 29(2) of the Act as substituted by the Gujarat Act 18 of 1965.This Court reiterated that although the High Court had wider power than that which could be exercised under section 115 of C.P.C.,yet its revisional power could only be exercised for a limited purpose with a view to satisfying itself that the decision was according to law\tPrecedent\nThe High Court could not substitute its own finding for the one reached by the courts below on a reappraisal of evidence\tPrecedent\nIn the instant case the basic question is whether keeping in background the partnership deeds referred to hereinbefore and the facts that came to light,was there partnership or not\tRatio of the decision\nSharing of profits and contributing to losses were not the only elements in a partnership,existence of agency was essential and whether there was a partnership or not is a mixed question of law and fact,depending upon the varying circumstances in different cases\tRatio of the decision\nThis view was reiterated by Chief Justice Beaumont,in Chimanram Motilal and another v\tPrecedent\nJayantilal Chhaganlal and another,A.I.R.1939 Bombay 410 1939 Indlaw MUM 155.Ramaswami,J.in Mohammed Musa Sahib (dead) and others v\tPrecedent\nN.K.Mohammed Ghouse Sahib and another,A.I.R.1959\tPrecedent\nMadras 379 1958 Indlaw MAD 820 observed that whether the relation of partnership between two or more persons does or does not exit must depend on the real intention and contract of the parties and not merely on their expressed intention\tPrecedent\nHe also referred to section 4 of the Partnership Act about the principles of partnership namely,(1) there must be agreement entered into by all the persons concerned; (2) the agreement must be to share the profits of a business; and (3) the business must be carried on by all or any of the persons concerned acting for all\tPrecedent\nIn the instant case judged by the aforesaid principles,it is possible to hold that there was a partnership of which the appellant was a partner\tRatio of the decision\nThe Court of Small Causes considered these principles,evaluated the evidence and held that there was in fact and in law a partnership\tRatio of the decision\nSuch a view was not an impossible one or a perverse one\tRatio of the decision\nIf that was so,there was nothing that could be clone about such a view,within the ambit and scope of the power of section 29(2) of the Rent Act\tRatio of the decision\nWe may mention that in Gundalapalli Rangamannar Chetty v\tPrecedent\nDesu Rangiah and others,A.I.R.1954\tPrecedent\nMadras 182,Subba Rao,J.as the learned Chief Justice then was,held that there cannot be a subletting,unless the lessee parted with legal possession\tPrecedent\nThe mere fact that another is allowed to use the premises while the lessee retains the legal possession is not enough to create a sub-lease\tPrecedent\nIn the light of the aforesaid principles and the facts that have emerged,we are of the opinion that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction under section 29(2) of the Rent Act\tRuling by Present Court\nWe are further of the opinion that the Court of Small Causes was right in the view it took\tRuling by Present Court\nand it was a possible view to take\tRuling by Present Court\nIn the result the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order of the Gujarat High Court dated 21st of August,1979 are set aside\tRuling by Present Court\nThe order and judgment of the Court of Small Causes Ahmedabad dated 18th of August,1977 are restored\tRuling by Present Court\nThe suit for possession is accordingly dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appellant herein is entitled to the costs throughout\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal Allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

incident\tFacts\nWhen the parents of the deceased came to the house of the accused and found the deceased hanging from the beam with a saree,they untied her and took her to the Government General Hospital,Guntur hoping that the deceased may be alive\tFacts\nHowever,upon medical examination by the doctor,she was declared brought dead\tFacts\nThe father of the deceased Pathan Yasin Khan,LW-1 and

IPC\tFacts\nThey were committed to the Court of Sessions,Guntur Division,Guntur for such an offence\tFacts\nThey faced the trial and the learned Sessions Judge vide its judgment dated 4th October,2004 found them guilty of the said offences and punished them as follows: \"Hence A.1 to A.3 are sentenced to undergo R.I.for THREE YEARS and further sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/each (total fine

before the High Court\tFacts\nThe High Court of Andhra Pradesh,vide its judgment dated 26th October,2006,while allowing the appeal in part,convicted accused Nos.1 and 2 for the aforementioned offences,however,acquitted accused No.3,namely,Pathan Khadar Basha\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe sentence awarded by the Trial Court was confirmed\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis gave rise to filing of the present appeals\tFacts\nFirst and the foremost,we must consider what is the evidence led by the prosecution to bring home the guilt of accused\tRatio of the decision\nAccused were charged with offences under Sections 498A and 304B of the IPC.The FIR in the present case was lodged by LW-1,who is the father of the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to this witness,on 23rd January,2002,the marriage of his daughter was solemnised with accused Pathan Hussain Basha and he had accepted to give Rs.25,000/in marriage\tRatio of the decision\nHe had given only Rs.15,000/and had agreed to pay Rs.10,000/-,after four months\tRatio of the decision\nThis witness has further specifically stated that the said accused treated his daughter in a proper manner for about two months\tRatio of the decision\nIn the marriage,he had also given a gold chain,a double bed,an iron safe and other items\tRatio of the decision\nHe had called his son-in-law,accused No.1,to his house,as per custom,at that point the accused demanded a ceiling fan\tRatio of the decision\nA ceiling fan was lying with the witness and he gave that to his son in law,however,he protested the same on the ground that the old fan is not acceptable to him and he would like to have a new fan,which was bought for Rs.650/by the witness and given to his son-in-law\tRatio of the decision\nWhen he again invited his son-in-law and the mother-in-law of his daughter,even then he had gifted some presents to them\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused asked for Rs.1,000/with a ring for the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nThe witness could pay only Rs.500/upon which the accused refused to take the deceased to the matrimonial home and went away\tRatio of the decision\nLater on,the accused came to fetch deceased\tRatio of the decision\nSubsequently,the motherin-law of the deceased,again,demanded the balance dowry amount of Rs.10,000/-,which he could not pay\tRatio of the decision\nHis daughter,after the Ramzan festival,had informed him that the accused persons were harassing her and were even beating and abusing her\tRatio of the decision\nAll three accused used to beat her for the remaining amount of dowry\tRatio of the decision\nOn 15th February,2003,a boy had come to him and told him that his daughter had died by hanging herself,whereupon he went to the house of the accused and found that his daughter was hanged to a wooden beam with a saree and she was dead\tRatio of the decision\nThe saree was removed,she was taken to the hospital where she was reported to have 'brought dead'.The statement of this witness i.e.LW-1 is corroborated by LW-3 and LW-7\tRatio of the decision\nIt is stated by LW-3 that she knew all the accused persons as she was residing in the house of the accused and the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to this witness also,in the beginning they were happy,however after some time,she used to hear some quarrel between the deceased and the accused persons\tRatio of the decision\nAccused No.2,Pathan Nazeer Abi had given her some amount and asked her to go and bring the soaps\tRatio of the decision\nAfter bringing the soaps,she went to the house of the accused persons and found that the accused was absent and the deceased was hanging on one side of the room\tRatio of the decision\nAfter seeing this,she raised cries and people came to the scene\tRatio of the decision\nLW-4,Pathan Inayatullah Khan,the grandson of LW-3,went to the house of the parents of the deceased and informed them about the unfortunate incident\tRatio of the decision\nLW-7 stated on oath that he was present at the time of giving of dowry to the accused by the family of the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nHe confirmed the fact that Rs.15,000/was given at the time of marriage and Rs.10,000/was to be given within some time,which the father of the deceased failed to provide\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to him,the accused persons used to harass the deceased primarily for non-payment of the amount of dowry,as a result of which,she was forced to commit suicide\tRatio of the decision\nIn fact,there is no dispute to the fact that the deceased died of hanging\tRatio of the decision\nDr\tRatio of the decision\nM.Madhusudana Reddy,LW-13 who was the Associate Professor in Forensic Medicine at Guntur Medical College,performed the post-mortem over the body of the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nIn the medical report,LW13,he noticed \"Oblique ligature mark of 17 x 2.5 cm present over front and left sides of neck\" as well as noticed \"Abrasion 1.5 x 1 cm present over lower part of middle of chin\tRatio of the decision\nInjuries were found to be antemortem in nature,and the cause of death was stated to be asphyxia,as a result of hanging\tRatio of the decision\nLW-14 is a witness to the seizure of the body and she noticed injuries on the body of the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the above evidence,it is clear that the dowry demands were being raised by the accused persons persistently from the family of the deceased and for that they even harassed the deceased,by beating and abusing her\tRatio of the decision\nShe had informed her parents of the ill-treatment and the cruelty inflicted on her for non-giving of dowry\tRatio of the decision\nThe period intervening between the marriage and the death of the deceased is very small\tRatio of the decision\nThey were married in the year 2002 and she committed suicide by hanging on 15th\tRatio of the decision\nFebruary,2003.The witnesses,including LW-1 have stated that for the first few months they were happy,but thereafter,there were quarrels between the accused and the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nAccused Pathan Hussain Basha,when he had gone to the parental house of the deceased,demanded different items like fan,ring and Rs.1,000/in cash,and the balance of the agreed dowry amount\tRatio of the decision\nSince,these demands were not satisfied instantaneously,he even left the deceased at her parental house\tRatio of the decision\nAt this stage,it will be appropriate for us to examine as to what are the ingredients of an offence punishable under Section 304B of the IPC\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of Biswajit Halder alias Babu Halder and Others v\tPrecedent\nState of W.B.[(2008) 1 SCC 202 2007 Indlaw SC 304],the Court stated the ingredients of this provision as follows: \"10.The basic ingredients to attract the provisions of Section 304-B are as follows\tPrecedent\n1) the death of a woman should be caused by burns or fatal injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances; (2) such death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage; (3) she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and (4) such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with demand for dowry\tPrecedent\n11.Alongside insertion of Section 304-B in IPC,the legislature also introduced Section 113-B of the Evidence Act,which lays down when the question as to whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for,or in connection with,any demand for dowry,the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death\tPrecedent\n12.Explanation appended to Section\tPrecedent\n113-B lays down that: \"For the purpose of this section,'dowry death' shall have the same meaning as in Section 304-B of Indian Penal Code\tPrecedent\n13.If\tPrecedent\nSection 304-B IPC is read together with Section 113-B of the Evidence Act,a comprehensive picture emerges that if a married woman dies in unnatural circumstances at her matrimonial home within 7 years from her marriage and there are allegations of cruelty or harassment upon such married woman for or in connection with demand of dowry by the husband or relatives of the husband,the case would squarely come under \"dowry death\" and there shall be a presumption against the husband and the relatives\tPrecedent\nBesides examining the ingredients of the provision,it would also be necessary for us to examine the meaning and connotation of the expressions 'dowry death','soon before her death' and 'in connection with,any demand for dowry' as appearing in the said section\tRatio of the decision\nAmongst others,lapse of time between the date of marriage and the date of death is also a relevant consideration for the Court while examining whether the essential ingredients of the provision are satisfied or not in a given case\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of Ashok Kumar v\tPrecedent\nState of Haryana [(2010) 12 SCC 350 2010 Indlaw SC 502],this Court explained these terms in some elucidation and the effect of the deeming fiction appearing in the section,as follows: \"11.The appellant was charged with an offence under Section 304-B of the Code\tPrecedent\nThis penal section clearly spells out the basic ingredients as well as the matters which are required to be construed strictly and with significance to the cases where death is caused by burns,bodily injury or the death occurring otherwise than under normal circumstances,in any manner,within seven years of a marriage\tPrecedent\nIt is the first criteria which the prosecution must prove\tPrecedent\nSecondly,that \"soon before her death\" she had been subjected to cruelty or harassment by the husband or any of the relatives of the husband for,or in connection with,any demand for dowry then such a death shall be called \"dowry death\" and the husband or the relative,as the case may be,will be deemed to have caused such a death\tPrecedent\nThe Explanation to this section requires that the expression \"dowry\" shall have the same meaning as in S.2 of the Act\tPrecedent\n12.The definition of \"dowry\" under S.2 of the Act reads as under: \"2.Definition of dowry\tPrecedent\nIn this Act,'dowry' means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly- (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or (b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person,to either party to the marriage or to any other person,at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties,but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies\tPrecedent\nExplanation II.-The expression 'valuable security' has the same meaning as in S.30 of the Penal Code (45 of 1860\tPrecedent\nFrom the above definition it is clear that,\"dowry\" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to another,by parents of either party to each other or any other person at,before,or at any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr under the Muslim Personal Law\tRatio of the decision\nAll the expressions used under this section are of a very wide magnitude\tRatio of the decision\nThe expressions \"or any time after marriage\" and \"in connection with the marriage of the said parties\" were introduced by the amending Act 63 of 1984 and Act 43 of 1986 with effect from 2-101985 and 19-11-1986 respectively\tRatio of the decision\nThese amendments appear to have been made with the intention to cover all demands at the time,before and even after the marriage so far they were in connection with the marriage of the said parties\tRatio of the decision\nThis clearly shows the intent of the legislature that these expressions are of wide meaning and scope\tRatio of the decision\nThe expression \"in connection with the marriage\" cannot be given a restricted or a narrower meaning\tRatio of the decision\nThe expression \"in connection with the marriage\" even in common parlance and on its plain language has to be understood generally\tRatio of the decision\nThe object being that everything,which is offending at any time i.e.at,before or after the marriage,would be covered under this definition,but the demand of dowry has to be \"in connection with the marriage\" and not so customary that it would not attract,on the face of it,the provisions of this section\tRatio of the decision\nAt this stage,it will be appropriate to refer to certain examples showing what has and has not been treated by the courts as \"dowry\".This Court,in Ran Singh v\tPrecedent\nState of Haryana,(2008) 4 SCC 700 2008 Indlaw SC 120 held that the payments which are customary payments,for example,given at the time of birth of a child or other ceremonies as are prevalent in the society or families to the marriage,would not be covered under the expression \"dowry\tPrecedent\nAgain,in Satvir Singh v\tPrecedent\nState of Punjab,(2001)8 SCC 633 2001 Indlaw SC 224\tPrecedent\nthis Court held that the word \"dowry\" should be any property or valuable given or agreed to be given in connection with the marriage\tPrecedent\nThe customary payments in connection with birth of a child or other ceremonies are not covered within the ambit of the word \"dowry\tPrecedent\nThis Court,in Madhu Sudan Malhotra v\tPrecedent\nKishore Chand Bhandari,1988 Supp\tPrecedent\nSCC 424 1987 Indlaw SC 28308 held that furnishing of a list of ornaments and other household articles such as refrigerator,furniture and electrical appliances,etc.to the parents or guardians of the bride,at the time of settlement of the marriage,prima facie amounts to demand of dowry within the meaning of S.2 of the Act\tPrecedent\nThe definition of \"dowry\" is not restricted to agreement or demand for payment of dowry before and at the time of marriage but even include subsequent demands,was the dictum of this Court in State of A.P.v\tPrecedent\nRaj Gopal Asawa,(2004)4 SCC 470 2004 Indlaw SC 205\tPrecedent\nThe courts have also taken the view that where the husband had demanded a specific sum from his father-in-law and upon not being given,harassed and tortured the wife and after some days she died,such cases would clearly fall within the definition of \"dowry\" under the Act\tRatio of the decision\nS.4 of the Act is the penal section and demanding a \"dowry\",as defined under S.2 of the Act,is punishable under this section\tRatio of the decision\nAs already noticed,we need not deliberate on this aspect,as the accused before us has neither been charged nor punished for that offence\tRatio of the decision\nWe have examined the provisions of S.2 of the Act in a very limited sphere to deal with the contentions raised in regard to the applicability of the provisions of Section 304-B of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nWe have already referred to the provisions of Section 304-B of the Code and the most significant expression used in the section is \"soon before her death\".In our view,the expression \"soon before her death\" cannot be given a restricted or a narrower meaning\tRatio of the decision\nThey must be understood in their plain language and with reference to their meaning in common parlance\tRatio of the decision\nThese are the provisions relating to human behaviour and,therefore,cannot be given such a narrower meaning,which would defeat the very purpose of the provisions of the Act Of course,these are penal provisions and must receive strict construction\tRatio of the decision\nBut,even the rule of strict construction requires that the provisions have to be read in conjunction with other relevant provisions and scheme of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nFurther,the interpretation given should be one which would avoid absurd results on the one hand and would further the object and cause of the law so enacted on the other\tRatio of the decision\nWe are of the considered view that the concept of reasonable time is the best criteria to be applied for appreciation and examination of such cases\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court in Tarsem Singh v\tPrecedent\nState of Punjab,(2008\tPrecedent\n16 SCC 155 2008 Indlaw SC 1962 held that the legislative object in providing such a radius of time by employing the words \"soon before her death\" is to emphasise the idea that her death should,in all probabilities,has been the aftermath of such cruelty or harassment\tPrecedent\nIn other words,there should be a reasonable,if not direct,nexus between her death and the dowryrelated cruelty or harassment inflicted on her\tPrecedent\nSimilar view was expressed by this Court in Yashoda v\tPrecedent\nState of M.P,(2004)3 SCC 98 2004 Indlaw SC 132 where this Court stated that determination of the period would depend on the facts and circumstances of a given case\tPrecedent\nHowever,the expression would normally imply that there has to be reasonable time gap between t he cruelty inflicted and the death in question\tRatio of the decision\nIf this is so,the legislature in its wisdom would have specified any period which would attract the provisions of this section\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,there must be existence of proximate link between the acts of cruelty along with the demand of dowry and the death of the victim\tRatio of the decision\nFor want of any specific period,the concept of reasonable period would be applicable\tRatio of the decision\nThus,the cruelty,harassment and demand of dowry should not be so ancient,whereafter,the couple and the family members have lived happily and that it would result in abuse of the said protection\tRatio of the decision\nSuch demand or harassment may not strictly and squarely fall within the scope of these provisions unless definite evidence was led to show to the contrary\tRatio of the decision\nThese matters,of course,will have to be examined on the facts and circumstances of a given case\tRatio of the decision\nThe cruelty and harassment by the husband or any relative could be directly relatable to or in connection with,any demand for dowry\tRatio of the decision\nThe expression \"demand for dowry\" will have to be construed ejusdem generis to the word immediately preceding this expression\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly,\"in connection with the marriage\" is an expression which has to be given a wider connotation\tRatio of the decision\nIt is of some significance that these expressions should be given appropriate meaning to avoid undue harassment or advantage to either of the parties\tRatio of the decision\nThese are penal provisions but ultimately these are the social legislations,intended to control offences relating to the society as a whole\tRatio of the decision\nDowry is something which existed in our country for a considerable time and the legislature in its wisdom considered it appropriate to enact the law relating to dowry prohibition so as to ensure that any party to the marriage is not harassed or treated with cruelty for satisfaction of demands in consideration and for subsistence of the marriage\tRatio of the decision\nThe Court cannot ignore one of the cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence that a suspect in the Indian law is entitled to the protection of Art.20 of the Constitution of India as well as has a presumption of innocence in his favour\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,the rule of law requires a person to be innocent till proved guilty\tRatio of the decision\nThe concept of deeming fiction is hardly applicable to the criminal jurisprudence\tRatio of the decision\nIn contradistinction to this aspect,the legislature has applied the concept of deeming fiction to the provisions of Section 304-B.Where other ingredients of Section 304-B are satisfied,in that event,the husband or all relatives shall be deemed to have caused her death\tRatio of the decision\nIn other words,the offence shall be deemed to have been committed by fiction of law\tRatio of the decision\nOnce the prosecution proves its case with regard to the basic ingredients of Section 304-B,the Court will presume by deemed fiction of law that the husband or the relatives complained of,has caused her death\tRatio of the decision\nSuch a presumption can be drawn by the Court keeping in view the evidence produced by the prosecution in support of the substantive charge under Section 304-B of the Code\tRatio of the decision\nApplying these principles to the facts of the present case,it is clear that the ingredients of Section 304B read with Section 498A IPC are completely satisfied in the present case\tRatio of the decision\nBy a deeming fiction in law,the onus shifts on to the accused to prove as to how the deceased died\tRatio of the decision\nIt is for the accused to show that the death of the deceased did not result from any cruelty or demand of dowry by the accused persons\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused did not care to explain as to how the death of his wife occurred\tRatio of the decision\nDenial cannot be treated to be the discharge of onus\tRatio of the decision\nOnus has to be discharged by leading proper and cogent evidence\tRatio of the decision\nIt was expected of the accused to explain as to how and why his wife died,as well as his conduct immediately prior and subsequent to the death of the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nMaintaining silence cannot be equated to discharge of onus by the accused\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,the prosecution by reliable and cogent evidence has established the guilt of the accused\tRatio of the decision\nThere being no rebuttal thereto,there is no occasion to interfere in the judgments of the courts under appeal\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court acquitted Pathan Khadar Basha,the fatherin-law of the deceased,as there was no direct evidence against him\tRatio of the decision\nHis acquittal has not been challenged by the State before us,thus,we are not called upon to discuss this aspect of the matter\tRatio of the decision\nAccused Pathan Hussain Basha and Pathan Nazeer Abi have rightly been found guilty of the offence by the courts\tRatio of the decision\nWhile we see no reason to differ with the concurrent findings recorded by the trial court and the High Court,we do see some substance in the argument raised on behalf of the appellants that keeping in view the prosecution evidence,the attendant circumstances,the age of the accused and the fact that they have already being in jail for a considerable period,the Court may take lenient view as far as the quantum of sentence is concerned\tRatio of the decision\nThe offences having been proved against the accused and keeping in view the attendant circumstances,we are of the considered view that ends of justice would be met,if the punishment awarded to the appellants is reduced\tRatio of the decision\nConsequently,we award ten years Rigorous Imprisonment to the appellants\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeals are partially accepted to the extent afore-indicated\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals partly allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

lobe was cut and there was 3 cm punctured wound\tFacts\nIncised wound was also present on the right lobe of size 3 cm x 1/3 cm x 3= cm\tFacts\nLiver,kidney and spleen were pale\tFacts\nThe deceased was carrying fetus of two months\tFacts\nThe sole eyewitness was a boy of 13 years of age -Anil Kumar (PW-21),who worked as a servant with the family\tFacts\nShashi Tripathi had brought him home from Bilaspur\tFacts\nHe participated in the identification parade,which was held in Sub Jail,Bemetara,and identified the accused persons in the court by touching them\tFacts\nWe have carefully examined the manner in which the identification parade was conducted and the manner in which the boy -Anil Kumar (PW-21) identified the accused in Court and we have no reason to doubt the identification of the accused,which assumes importance in this case since the boy did not know the accused before the incident\tRatio of the decision\nIt is Anil Kumar (PW -21),who first informed the head of the family Dr\tFacts\nSharda Prasad Tripathi (PW-1),the complainant,about the incident,when he came home after closing his clinic\tFacts\nHe deposed before the Court that Shashi Didi (accused) brought him to village -Jevra from Bilaspur\tFacts\nHe lived in the house of Shashi Didi\tFacts\nHe ate his food there and studied in a school\tFacts\nHe deposed that Doctor Sahab is her husband and Shivendra and Jitendra are her sons\tFacts\nJitendra is her step-son and the deceased Bhavna is the wife of Jitendra\tFacts\nShe resided with Shashi Didi\tFacts\nJitendra is a doctor,resided and practiced at Khamaria,whereas his wife resided at Jevra\tFacts\nHis brother -Shivendra studies at Calcutta\tFacts\nHe referred to Bhavna as Bhabhi\tFacts\nHe stated that Shashi Didi and Bhavna sometimes used to quarrel\tFacts\nAbout the assault,he deposed that Devendra caught Bhavna and Chandra Prakash attacked her with knife 3 to 4 times and she fell down\tFacts\nThe incident occurred in the courtyard and Shashi Didi was present in the passage\tFacts\nMahesh,the fourth accused,was standing outside the house\tFacts\nAfter the assault,Chandra Prakash went to the TV room where Shashi Didi had kept some money in a rubber band on the table\tFacts\nThe accused -Chandra Prakash had threatened him not to disclose anything about the incident to anyone\tFacts\nThereafter all the three accused fled from there\tFacts\nHe further deposed that Shashi Didi took him upstairs to the terrace and asked him not to disclose the truth to anyone but to say that thieves came into the house and committed the crime\tFacts\nShashi Didi thereafter started shouting\tFacts\nThen she lay down on the courtyard near Bhavna Bhabhi\tFacts\nThis deposition clearly implicates accused Nos.1,2 and 4.The picture that emerges is that Shashi Tripathi caused Bhavna to be killed and for this purpose engaged Chandra Prakash (accused No.2) and Raju\tRatio of the decision\nDevendra Choubey (accused No.4) by paying them money\tRatio of the decision\nShe also seems to have had a scuffle with Bhavna,which is apparent from the fact that her hair was found in the grip of the deceased during investigation\tRatio of the decision\nIt is obvious that accused nos.2 and 4 did not enter the house to commit a robbery and had a single mission,namely,to kill Bhavana\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence that they had any previous animosity with the deceased and appeared to have acted as contract killers\tRatio of the decision\nThe prosecution has found it difficult to pinpoint the motive but Shashi Tripathi's husband Dr\tRatio of the decision\nSharda Prasad Tripathi (PW-1) deposed before the Court that she tried to create a hindrance in the marriage of his son Jitendra since she wanted her daughter Abhilasha to marry him; however,he went ahead with the marriage of Jitendra to Bhavna,whereupon Shashi Tripathi remained silent\tRatio of the decision\nThe credibility of the evidence of Anil Kumar (PW-21) was attacked by the learned counsel for the appellants,who submitted that the boy is a tutored witness,who has been influenced by the police with whom he spent a lot of time\tArgument\nIn fact,he even came to the Court in the company of a police constable after being served summons at Allahabad\tArgument\nThe learned counsel submitted that the evidence of a child witness must be carefully scrutinized before acceptance since a child can be easy prey for tutoring and the court must insist on corroboration from other evidence\tArgument\nOn a careful perusal of the deposition of this child witness,we have not found any reason why he would have lied\tRatio of the decision\nHe was brought to the house by Shashi Tripathi (accused),who apparently took care of him and sent to school and gave him food and residence\tRatio of the decision\nHe had no grouse against her neither any ulterior motive in identifying the accused,who were not acquainted to him\tRatio of the decision\nThere was no reason for the sole eye witness -Anil (PW-21) to implicate anybody falsely\tRatio of the decision\nMerely because he has been some time in the company of the police at the police station his testimony cannot be discarded as untrue\tRatio of the decision\nThe incident occurred within the four walls of the house of the accused -Shashi Tripathi and the only witness was the boy -Anil\tRatio of the decision\nPW-21).His statement that the accused Chandra Prakash attacked the deceased is corroborated by the recovery of knife from Chandra Prakash\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be remembered that the boy comes from a rural back ground and was 13 years of age when the incident occurred\tRatio of the decision\nHis presence in the house is entirely natural and we have no reason to discard his testimony\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel for the appellants forcefully attacked the conviction of the other accused viz\tArgument\nMahesh,Chandra Prakash and Devendra Kumar,who admittedly were not known to the child witness Anil Kumar\tArgument\nIt was submitted that the test identification parade were delayed and the identification of these accused by the witness in Court was not reliable\tArgument\nIt is not possible for us to accept this contention\tRatio of the decision\nMahesh and Chandra Prakash were arrested on 29.11.2003,their identification parade was conducted on 13.12.2003 -(within a fortnight or so\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused Devendra Kumar was arrested on 22.12.2003 and his identification parade was conducted on 26.12.2003-(within four days).There is no evidence on record to show that the child witness had an opportunity to see and study the features of the accused between their arrest and test identification parade to enable a tutored identification\tRatio of the decision\nIn any case,the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel for the appellants relied upon the Judgment of this Court in Budhsen and Anr\tPrecedent\nVs\tPrecedent\nState of U.P.(1970) 2 SCC 128 1970 Indlaw SC 136 where this Court made the following observations:- \"7.Now,facts which establish the identity of an accused person are relevant u/s.9 of the Indian Evidence Act\tPrecedent\nAs a general rule,the substantive evidence of a witness is a statement made in court\tPrecedent\nThe evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character\tPrecedent\nThe evidence in order to carry conviction should ordinarily clarify as to how and under what circumstances he came to pick out the particular accused person and the details of the part which the accused played in the crime in question with reasonable particularity\tPrecedent\nThe purpose of a prior test identification,therefore,seems to be to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence\tPrecedent\nIt is accordingly considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding\tPrecedent\nThere may,however,be exceptions to this general rule,when for example,the court is impressed by a particular witness,on whose testimony it can safely rely,without such or other corroboration\tPrecedent\nThe identification parades belong to the investigation stage\tPrecedent\nThey are generally held during the course of investigation with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence,who were not previously known to them\tPrecedent\nThis serves to satisfy the investigating officers of the bona fides of the prosecution witnesses and also to furnish evidence to corroborate their testimony in court\tPrecedent\nIdentification proceedings in their legal effect amount simply to this: that certain persons are brought to jail or some other place and make statements either express or implied that certain individuals whom they point out are persons whom they recognise as having been concerned in the crime\tPrecedent\nThey do not constitute substantive evidence\tPrecedent\nThese parades are of the essentially governed by Section 162,Criminal Procedure Code\tPrecedent\nIt is for this reason that the identification parades in this case seem to have been held under the supervision of a Magistrate\tPrecedent\nKeeping in view the purpose of identification parades the Magistrates holding them are expected to take all possible precautions to eliminate any suspicion of unfairness and to reduce the chance of testimonial error\tPrecedent\nThey must,therefore,take intelligent interest in the proceedings,bearing in mind two considerations: (i) that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution and (ii) that justice should be done in the identification\tPrecedent\nThose proceeding should not make it impossible for the identifiers who,after all,have,as a rule,only fleeting glimpses of the person they are supposed to identify\tPrecedent\nGenerally speaking,the Magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused,so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence\tPrecedent\nThe power to identify,it may be kept in view,varies according to the power of observation and memory of the person identifying and each case depends on its own facts,but there are two factors which seem to be of basic importance in the evaluation of identification\tPrecedent\nThe persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of the crime and before identification and secondly that no mistakes are made by them or the mistakes made are negligible\tPrecedent\nThe identification to be of value should also be held without much delay\tPrecedent\nThe number of persons mixed up with the accused should be reasonably large and their bearing and general appearance not glaringly dissimilar\tPrecedent\nThe evidence as to identification deserves,therefore,to be subjected to a close and careful scrutiny by the Court\tPrecedent\nThe observations of this Court undoubtedly lay down the correct law and we have no reason to doubt them\tRatio of the decision\nWe,however,do not see how the observations help the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,the child witness has been found to be reliable\tRatio of the decision\nHis presence is not doubted,since he resided with the family for whom he worked\tRatio of the decision\nHe had no axe to grind against any of the accused\tRatio of the decision\nHe became the unfortunate witness of a gruesome murder and fearlessly identified the accused in Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn his deposition he specified the details of the part which the accused played with reasonable particularity\tRatio of the decision\nIn such a situation,it is considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witness in Court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding,as observed by this Court in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court has not laid down the requirement in general that all identification parades must be under the supervision of a Magistrate as in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra).The learned counsel for the appellants also relied upon the Judgments of this Court in Subash and Shiv Kumar Vs\tRatio of the decision\nState of U.P.(1987) 3 SCC 331 1987 Indlaw SC 28887,and Mohd\tRatio of the decision\nAbdul Hafeez Vs\tRatio of the decision\nState of Andhra Pradesh AIR 1983\tRatio of the decision\nSC 367 1982 Indlaw SC 63.The facts and circumstances of the cases are however different and it is not necessary to consider those cases in detail while dealing with the present case\tRatio of the decision\nSuffice it to say that those cases do not create any doubt as regards the conviction in this case\tRatio of the decision\nMr\tArgument\nP.C.Agrawala,learned senior counsel for the appellant Mahesh (accused no.3),vehemently submitted that this accused ought not to have been convicted u/s.302 with the aid of Ss.34 and 120 (B) of IPC.In particular it was submitted that the role attributed to the accused was that he merely stood outside the house\tArgument\nHe did not even act as a guard because when the witness Anil Kumar (PW-21) came to the house,he was not even stopped by the accused from entering the house\tArgument\nThe learned counsel for Mahesh (accused no.3) relied on several decisions of this Court in Suresh Sakharam Nangare Vs\tArgument\nState of Maharashtra (2012) 9 SCC 249 2012 Indlaw SC 304,Jai Bhagwan Vs\tArgument\nState of Haryana AIR 1999 SC 1083 1999 Indlaw SC 391 and Ramashish Yadav Vs\tArgument\nState of Bihar (1999) 8 SCC 555 1999 Indlaw SC 693\tArgument\nIt is settled law that common intention and conspiracy are matters of inference and if while drawing an inference any benefit of doubt creeps in,it must go to the accused vide Baliya Vs\tRatio of the decision\nState of M.P.(2012\tRatio of the decision\n9 SCC 696 2012 Indlaw SC 343\tRatio of the decision\nOn a careful conspectus of the facts and the law,we are of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of Mahesh beyond reasonable doubt\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime\tRatio of the decision\nHe was merely seen by the witness as standing outside the house when the witness came home\tRatio of the decision\nMahesh did not even act as a guard; he did not prevent Anil Kumar (PW-21) from entering the house\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no reference to a third person in the FIR; no evidence that he came with the other accused or left with them\tRatio of the decision\nNo weapon was seized from him,nor was any property connected with the crime,seized\tRatio of the decision\nHaving regard to the role attributed to him and the absence of incriminating factors we find that it is not safe to convict Mahesh of the offence of murder with the aid of Ss.34 and 120(B\tRatio of the decision\nWe therefore,hold that the accused Mahesh (accused no.3) in Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2013 is innocent and the conviction against him is set aside\tRuling by Present Court\nHis bail bonds stand cancelled and sureties are discharged\tRuling by Present Court\nIn view of the above,Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2013 is allowed and Criminal Appeal Nos.822 of 2012,589 of 2014 and Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.3737 of 2014 are dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals disposed of\tRuling by Present Court\n"

Mehta (since deceased) purchased nine residential flats in a building called Madhuli Apartments in Worli area of Mumbai\tFacts\nThe family of the Appellants consists of four brothers, their wives, children and their widowed mother\tFacts\nThe eldest among them, Harshad S. Mehta, has since expired\tFacts\nThe said nine flats, it is said, were merged and redesigned for joint living of the entire family\tFacts\nThe Appellants herein and the said\tFacts\nlate Harshad Mehta were persons notified in terms of the Act which was enacted to provide for the establishment of a Special Court for the trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and for matters connected therewith\tFacts\nIn terms of the provisions of the Act, along with late Harshad Mehta, the Custodian had notified 29 entities in terms of S. 3 of the Act, comprising three of his younger brothers, wife of late Harshad Mehta, wives of two of his younger brothers and other corporate entities, a partnership firm and three HUFs\tFacts\nHowever, out of the said 29 entitles, only Late Harshad Mehta and two of his younger brothers were cited as accused in various criminal cases filed against them\tFacts\nThe properties of Late Harshad Mehta and the Appellants, herein being notified persons stood attached in terms of the provisions of the Act\tFacts\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE SPECIAL COURT\tFacts\nBefore the learned Special Court, the parties herein filed several applications which can be sub-divided in three categories, as would be noticed shortly hereinafter\tFacts\nIt is not in dispute that the learned Special Court on or about 3.August.1993 issued directions in various proceedings before it appointing auditors to prepare and audit the books of accounts of all notified persons for the period 1.April.1990 and 8.June.1992, i.e., the date of the notification\tFacts\nThree firms of Chartered Accountants were appointed to prepare statement of accounts and liabilities of each of the Appellants, herein\tFacts\nA Chartered Accountants' Firm was appointed by the learned Special Judge by an order dated 17.September.2003 to represent all notified entities in the family of late Harshad Mehta for the purpose of ascertaining their tax liabilities\tFacts\nWe may, at this juncture, notice the nature of the applications filed by the parties, herein before the learned Special Court: (i\tFacts\nOn 26.April.1999, the Custodian filed an application being Misc\tFacts\nApplication No. 41 of 1999 seeking permission of the Special Court for sale of residential premises commonly known as Madhuli of eight notified entities\tFacts\nii\tRatio of the decision\nA Misc\tFacts\nApplication being 4 of 2001 was filed by the Custodian praying for the sale of commercial premises\tFacts\niii\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants herein filed several Misc\tFacts\nApplications praying for lifting of attachment on their residential premises on the ground that the same had been purchased much prior to 1.April.1991 and the same had no nexus with any illegal transactions in securities\tFacts\nAlternatively, it was prayed that since their asset base was greater than genuine liabilities, the said residential premises should be released from attachment\tFacts\nIMPUGNED JUDGMENT\tRuling by Lower Court\nBy reason of the impugned order dated 17.October.2003, the learned Special Judge allowed Misc\tFacts\nApplications Nos\tFacts\n4 of 2001 and 41 of 1999\tFacts\nThe Misc\tFacts\nApplications filed by the Appellants herein for release of the residential flats as well as the commercial premises from attachment were dismissed\tFacts\nIt was directed: \"In case, all adult members of the family of late Shri Harshad Metha, who are presently occupying the abovereferred flats, file an undertaking in this Court within a period of four weeks from today undertaking to vacate the flat occupied by them and hand over peaceful possession thereof to the custodian within a period of four weeks from the date on which the custodian sends them communication asking them to vacate the flats, on sale of the flats being sanctioned by the Court\tFacts\nThe custodian shall permit the members of family of late Shri Harshad Mehta to occupy the flats during the time that the process of the sale of the flats goes on\tFacts\nIn case no such undertakings are filed by the adult members as directed above, within the aforesaid period, the custodian shall stand appointed as receiver of the flats which are described in Exh\tFacts\n8 and Exh\tFacts\n8-1 to Misc\tFacts\nPetition No. 41 of 1999\tFacts\nCONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES Appellants 9\tArgument\nMr. Mahesh Jethmalani, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants in assailing the said judgment of the learned Special Court inter alia raised the following contentions: (i\tArgument\nSome of the entities having their asset base much more than actual liability, the impugned judgments are unsustainable\tArgument\nThere was no occasion for the Custodian to club all the notified entities in one block so as to be termed as Harshad Mehta Group and/or to club their assets and liabilities jointly\tArgument\nAlthough in relation to a body corporate incorporated and registered under the Indian Companies Act, the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil would be applicable, but the same cannot be applied in case of individuals\tArgument\nii) Having regard to the fact that only three entitles out of eight were involved in the offences, the liability of Harshad Mehta could not have been clubbed for the purpose of directing attachment and consequent sale of the properties which exclusively belong to them\tArgument\nThe liabilities of Harshad Mehta, who was a sui generis, could have been recovered from the properties held and possessed by him or from the companies floated by him but not from the individual entities; at least two of whom being medical practitioners have their income from other sources\tArgument\niv\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe books of accounts and other documents on the basis whereof the auditor's report had been made having not been allowed to be inspected by the Appellants herein on the plea that they had the knowledge thereabout, the same could not have been taken into consideration for the purpose of passing of the impugned order or otherwise\tArgument\nv) The Appellants having preferred appeals against the income tax orders of assessment passed by the authority and the same having been set aside, no liability to pay income tax by the Appellants as of now being existing, the residential properties could not have been sold\tArgument\nvi) Drawing our attention to a representative chart showing the discrepancies in the accounts of Mrs. Deepika A. Mehta as shown in (a) affidavit by the Custodian; (b) Books of Accounts maintained by the Appellants; and (c\tArgument\nAuditor's Report, it was submitted that the Auditor's Report could not have been relied upon\tArgument\nvii\tRatio of the decision\nA copy of the Auditor's Report having only been supplied during pendency of these appeals, the learned Special Judge committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment relying on or on the basis thereof\tArgument\nRespondents\tArgument\nMr. Ashok H. Desai, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Custodian, on the other hand, would, inter alia, submit\tArgument\ni)In view of the decision of this Court in L.S. Synthetics Ltd. v. Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd. and Another [(2004) 11 SCC 456] 2004 Indlaw SC 715 all properties belonging to the notified persons being subject to automatic attachment, could be applied for discharge of the joint liabilities of the Harshad Mehta Group in terms of S. 11 of the Act\tArgument\nii)The applications for de-notification filed by the Appellants herein having been withdrawn, the contention raised by the Appellants that they are not liable in terms of the provisions of the Act are not open to question, particularly, in view of the fact that no application for de-notification could be filed subsequently as they had become barred by limitation\tArgument\niii)The order of assessment under the Income Tax Act having become final and binding as on the date when the orders of assessment were passed and, thus, mere filing of appeals, were not sufficient for raising a contention that the taxes did not become due\tArgument\nReliance in this behalf has been placed on B.C. Dalal 2005 Indlaw SC 1826 v. Custodian\tArgument\nCivil Appeal No. 2795 of 2004] and The Kedarnath Jute Mfg\tArgument\nCo. Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Income Tax\tArgument\nCentral), Calcutta [(1972) 3 SCC 252] 1971 Indlaw SC 841\tArgument\niv)The Appellants herein, apart from the corporate entity which is a front company of late Harshad Mehta, have received large loans, advances and credits from the Harshad Mehta Group and there had been intermingling of the assets to the tune of crores of rupees, they cannot escape their liabilities under the Act\tArgument\nThe affidavit filed by the Appellants herein before the Special Court clearly shows that the liabilities exceed the assets in all cases\tArgument\nEven in the case of Dr. Pratima Mehta wherein some excesses has been shown, if the interest is calculated for the last over 13 years of the amount received, the liabilities would exceed the assets\tArgument\nv) The assets and liabilities of each of the entities having been audited by the Chartered Accountants, it is evident from the reports that in all cases liabilities exceed the assets\tArgument\nvi)The decretal amount against the Harshad Mehta Group also would exceed Rs\tArgument\n4339 crores and, thus, the assets held by the Appellants are wholly insufficient to meet the liabilities\tArgument\nvii)Furthermore, the Appellants are also unable to maintain their residential properties as the Custodian had to pay a sum of Rs\tArgument\n1.06 crores towards the maintenance of the said residential properties\tArgument\nThe assets of the Harshad Mehta Group are valued at Rs\tArgument\n972 crores apart from the income tax dues whereas the aggregate amount of income tax dues exceed Rs\tArgument\n13,800 crores\tArgument\nviii)Dr. Hitesh Mehta and Dr. Pratima Mehta who are medical practitioners by profession having affirmed affidavits admitting that the share broking and investment businesses which were part of family businesses were undertaken and conducted by late Harshad Mehta and they had no knowledge thereabout nor were they involved therewith\tArgument\nthey at this stage cannot be permitted to turn round and contend that they have nothing to do with the liabilities of Late Harshad Mehta\tArgument\nix)The sale of commercial property had never been seriously contested by the Appellants and in fact the contention of the Appellants herein before the Special Court was that if the commercial properties were sold, there would be no need to sell the residential properties\tArgument\nEven before this Court, the sale of commercial properties had not been questioned\tArgument\nA large number of commercial properties having already been sold and third party rights having been created, this Court should not interfere with the impugned judgment\tArgument\nTHE ACT\tArgument\nThe Statement of Objects and Reasons for enacting the Act reads as under: \"(1) In the course of the investigations by the Reserve Bank of India, large scale irregularities and malpractices were noticed in transactions in both the Government and other securities, indulged in by some brokers in collusion with the employees of various banks and financial institutions\tStatute\nThe said irregularities and malpractices led to the diversion of funds from banks and financial institutions to the individual accounts of certain brokers\tStatute\n2) To deal with the situation and in particular to ensure speedy recovery of the huge amount involved, to punish the guilty and restore confidence in and maintain the basic integrity and credibility of the banks and financial institutions the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Ordinance, 1992, was promulgated on the 6th June, 1992\tStatute\nThe Ordinance provides for the establishment of a Special Court with a sitting Judge of a High Court for speedy trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and disposal of properties attached\tStatute\nIt also provides for appointment of one or more custodians for attaching the property of the offenders with a view to prevent diversion of such properties by the offenders\tStatute\nS. 3 of the Act provides for appointment and functions of the Custodian\tStatute\nSub-s\tStatute\n2) of S. 3 postulates that the Custodian may, on being satisfied on information received that any person has been involved in any offence relating to transactions in securities after the 1st day of April, 1991 and on and before 6th June, 1992 (the Statutory Period), notify the name of such person in the Official Gazette\tStatute\n3) of S. 3 contains a non-obstante clause providing that on and from the date of notification under sub-section (2), any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to any person notified under that sub-section shall stand attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification and such attached properties may be dealt with by the Custodian in such manner as the Special Court may direct\tStatute\nIn the Ordinance which preceded the Act, there was no provision for giving post facto hearing to a notified person for cancellation of notification, but such a provision has been made in the Act, as would appear from S. 4(2) thereof\tStatute\n1) of S. 4 of the Act reads as under: \"Contracts entered into fraudulently may be cancelled.-- If the Custodian is satisfied, after such inquiry as he may think fit, that any contract or agreement entered into at any time after the 1st day of April, 1991 and on and before the 6th June, 1992 in relation to any property of the person notified under sub-s\tStatute\n2) of s. 3 has been entered into fraudulently or to defeat the provisions of this Act, he may cancel such contract or agreement and on such cancellation such property shall stand attached under this Act\tStatute\nProvided that no contract or agreement shall be cancelled except after giving to the parties to the contract or agreement a reasonable opportunity of being heard\tStatute\n2) of Section 4, however, provides for a hearing as regard correctness or

achieve\tRatio of the decision\nThe right of a person notified to file an application or to raise a defence that he is not liable in terms of the provisions of the Act or in any event, the properties attached should not be sold in discharge of the liabilities can be taken at the initial stage by filing an application in terms of Sub-s\tRatio of the decision\n2) of S. 4 of the Act\tRatio of the

decision\nRECEDENTS AS REGARD SCOPE OF THE ACT\tPrecedent\nConstitutionality and / or interpretation of the Act came up for consideration before this Court in Harshad Shantilal\tPrecedent\nMehta 1998\tPrecedent\nIndlaw SC 732 v. Custodian and Others [(1998) 5 SCC 1] wherein the following questions were framed: \"What is meant by revenues, taxes, cesses and rates due\tPrecedent\nDoes the word \"due\" refer merely to the liability to pay such taxes etc., or does it refer to a liability which has crystallised into a legally ascertained sum immediately payable\tPrecedent\nDo the taxes [in cl\tPrecedent\na) of S. 11(2)] refer only to taxes relating to a specific period or to all taxes due from the notified person\tPrecedent\nAt what point of time should the taxes have become due\tPrecedent\nDoes the Special Court have any discretion relating to the extent of payments to be made under S. 11(2)(a) from out of the attached funds/property\tPrecedent\nWhether taxes include penalty or interest\tPrecedent\nWhether the Special Court has the power to absolve a notified person from payment of penalty or interest for a period subsequent to the date of his notification u/s\tPrecedent\nIn the alternative, is a notified person liable to payment of penalty or interest arising from his inability to pay taxes after his notification\tPrecedent\nAs regard, Question No. 1, it was held: \"In the present case, the words \"taxes due\" occur in a section dealing with distribution of property\tPrecedent\nAt this stage the taxes \"due\" have to be actually paid out\tPrecedent\nTherefore, the phrase \"taxes due\" cannot refer merely to a liability created by the charging section to pay the tax under the relevant law\tPrecedent\nIt must refer to an ascertained liability for payment of taxes quantified in accordance with law\tPrecedent\nIn other words, taxes as assessed which are presently payable by the notified person are taxes which have to be taken into account under S. 11(2)(a) while distributing the property of the notified person\tPrecedent\nTaxes which are not legally assessed or assessments which have not become final and binding on the assessee, are not covered under S. 11(2)(a) because unless it is an ascertained and quantified liability, disbursement cannot be made\tPrecedent\nIn the context of S. 11(2), therefore, \"the taxes due\" refer to \"taxes as finally assessed\tPrecedent\nIn regard to Question No. 2, it was opined: \"Every kind of tax liability of the notified person for any other period is not covered by S. 11(2)(a), although the liability may continue to be the liability of the notified person\tPrecedent\nSuch tax liability may be discharged either under the directions of the Special Court under S. 11(2)(c), or the taxing authority may recover the same from any subsequently acquired property of a notified person (vide Tejkumar Balakrishna Ruia v. A.K. Menon 1996 Indlaw SC 2403) or in any other manner from the notified person in accordance with law\tPrecedent\nThe priority, however, which is given under S. 11(2)(a) to such tax liability only covers such liability for the period 1-4-1991 to 6-6-1992\tPrecedent\nIn respect of the Question No. 3, it was opined that the date of distribution arrives when the Special Court completes the examination of claims under Section 9-A and if on that date, any tax liability for the statutory period is legally assessed, and the assessment is final and binding on a notified person, that liability would be considered for payment u/s\tPrecedent\n11(1)(a\tPrecedent\nsubject to what follows\tPrecedent\nSo far as Question No. 4 is concerned, this Court despite upholding the contention of the Custodian that no question of any reopening of tax assessments before the Special Court would arise and the liability of the notified person to pay the tax will have to be determined under the machinery provided by the relevant tax law, observed: \"But the Special Court can decide how much of that liability will be discharged out of the funds in the hands of the Custodian\tPrecedent\nThis is because the tax liability of a notified person having priority under S. 11(2)(a) is only tax liability pertaining to the \"statutory period\tPrecedent\nSecondly payment in full may or may not be made by the Special Court depending upon various circumstances\tPrecedent\nThe Special Court can, for this purpose, examine whether there is any fraud, collusion or miscarriage of justice in assessment proceedings\tPrecedent\nThe assessee who is before the Special Court, is a person liable to be charged with an offence relating to transactions in securities\tPrecedent\nHe may not, in these circumstances, explain transactions before the Income Tax authorities, in case his position is prejudicially affected in defending criminal charges\tPrecedent\nThen, on account of his property being attached, he may not be in a position to deposit the tax assessed or file appeals or further proceedings under the relevant tax law which he could have otherwise done\tPrecedent\nWhere the assessment is based on proper material and pertains to the \"statutory period\", the Special Court may not reduce the tax claimed and pay it out in full\tPrecedent\nBut if the assessment is a \"best judgment\" assessment, the Special Court may examine whether, for example, the income which is so assessed to tax bears comparison to the amounts attached by the Custodian, or whether the taxes so assessed are grossly disproportionate to the properties of the assessee in the hands of the Custodian, applying the Wednesbury Principle of Proportionality\tPrecedent\nThe Special Court may in these cases, scale down the tax liability to be paid out of the funds in the hands of the Custodian\tPrecedent\nIn regard to Question No. 5, this Court agreed with the finding of the Special Court that neither penalty nor interest can be considered as tax under S. 11(2)(a) of the Act\tPrecedent\nSo far Question No. 6 is concerned, it was held that the remedy of a notified person who is assessed to penalty or interest, after the notified period, would be entitled to move the appropriate authority under the taxing statute stating: \"If it is open to him under the relevant taxing statute to contend that he was unable to pay his taxes on account of the attachment of all his properties under the Special Court Act, and that there is a valid reason why penalty or interest should not be imposed upon him after the date of notification, the authorities concerned under the taxing statute can take notice of these circumstances in accordance with law for the purpose of deciding whether penalty or interest can be imposed on the notified person\tPrecedent\nThe Special Court is required to consider this question only from the point of view of distributing any part of the surplus assets in the hands of the Custodian after the discharge of liabilities u/ss\tPrecedent\n11(2)(a) and 11(2)(b\tPrecedent\nThe Special Court has full discretion under S. 11(2)(c) to decide whether such claim for penalty or interest should be paid out of any surplus funds in the hands of the Custodian\tPrecedent\nWe must, however, notice that reliance was sought to be placed on the said judgment wherein reference was made to a Bombay High Court judgment in Hitesh Shantilal Mehta v. Union of India\tPrecedent\n1992) 3 Bom CR 716] 1992 Indlaw MUM 6066 wherein it was held: \"If the person ... approaches the Special Court and makes out, for example, a case that the property which is attached has no nexus of any sort with the illegal dealings in securities belonging to banks and financial institutions during the relevant period and/or that there are no claims or liabilities which have to be satisfied by attachment and sale of such property, in our view, the Special Court would have the power to direct the Custodian to release such property from attachment\tPrecedent\nBut, the said observation was held to be not laying down a law by a 3-Judge Bench of this Court in L.S. Synthetics Ltd. v. Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd. and Another [(2004) 11 SCC 456] 2004 Indlaw SC 715 holding: \"(i\tPrecedent\nA notified party has the requisite locus to bring the fact to the notice of the Special Court that certain sum is owing and due to him from a third party whereupon a proceeding can be initiated for recovery thereof by the Custodian and consequent application thereof in discharge of the liability of the notified person\tPrecedent\nii) Sub-s\tPrecedent\n3) of S. 3 should be literally construed and so construed, all properties belonging to the notified person shall be subject to attachment which may, consequently, be applied for discharge of his liabilities in terms of S. 11 of the said Act\tPrecedent\nThe provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 have no application in relation to the proceedings under the said Act\tPrecedent\nThe ratio of the said decision as regard applicability of the Limitation Act was further considered by a Division bench of this Court in Fairgrowth Investments Ltd\tPrecedent\nv. Custodian [(2004) 11 SCC 472] 2004 Indlaw SC 868 wherein it was held that S. 5 of the Limitation Act will have no application in relation to an application falling under Sub-s\tPrecedent\n2) of S. 4 of the Act stating: \"It is enough for the purpose of this appeal to hold that S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 does not apply to proceedings under S. 4(2) of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992\tPrecedent\nSince the appellant's petition of objection had been filed much beyond the period prescribed under that section, the Special Court was right in rejecting the petition in limine\tPrecedent\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed but without any order as to costs\tPrecedent\nThe Appellants herein are notified persons in terms of the provisions of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, all the properties belonging to them stand attached\tRatio of the decision\nSuch attachment being automatic, no finding was required to be arrived at that the same had been acquired either during the notified period or the Appellants were involved in offences in transactions in securities\tRatio of the decision\nIn Tejkumar Balakrishna Ruia v. A.K. Menon and Another [(1997) 9 SCC 123] 1996 Indlaw SC 2403, this Court held: \"In our view, the terms of sub-s\tPrecedent\n3) of S. 3 are clear\tPrecedent\nBy reason thereof, the property that belongs to a notified person stands attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification that makes him a notified party\tPrecedent\nThe words \"on and from the date of notification\" indicate the point of time at which the attachment takes effect; this is reiterated by the words \"shall stand attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification\tPrecedent\nThis also indicates that no separate notification or order in regard to the attachment is necessary\tPrecedent\nNeither the words \"on and from the date of notification\" nor the word 'property' lead to the conclusion that what is attached is not only that property which the notified person owned or was possessed of on the date of the notification but also all such property as he might acquire at any time thereafter\tPrecedent\nThe intention to attach property which did not belong to the notified person on the date of the notification but which he might acquire later would, had it been there, have been clearly expressed and sub-s\tPrecedent\n3) would have stated that such property would stand attached the moment it was acquired by the notified person\tPrecedent\nThe Act would also have made provision for a subsistence allowance or the like for the notified person\tPrecedent\nIt seems to us that to give to S. 3(3) the wide meaning that has been ascribed to it in the judgment and order under appeal would render it perilously close to being held unconstitutional, for it would deprive the notified person, so long as he remained a notified person, from earning a livelihood\tPrecedent\nEven to say that such interpretation would reduce a notified person to beggary would not be accurate  because the alms that he received, being his property, would stand attached\tPrecedent\nThe apprehension expressed by the Special Court does not appear to be well founded: if what a notified person obtains by way of purported income or gift or inheritance is really his own money, such money would, upon establishment of the fact, stand attached automatically under the provisions of S. 3(3\tPrecedent\nIn any event, it is for Parliament to enact a law that meets all contingencies\tPrecedent\nThe courts must interpret the law as it reads\tPrecedent\nWhile a purposive interpretation is permissible where two interpretations are possible, the purposive interpretation must be such as preserves the constitutionality of the provision\tPrecedent\nIt has further been held that the property, be shares, dividends and bonus and rights shares, would also be attached property\tPrecedent\nISSUES\tRatio of the decision\ni)Whether the Appellants being not involved in offences in transactions in securities could have been proceeded against in terms of the

the questions raised herein, we may notice that both the parties have raised several contentions before us which have not precisely been raised before the learned Special Judge\tRatio of the decision\nSeveral subsequent events have also been brought to our notice\tRatio of the decision\nThe parties have also filed several charts before us showing individual assets and liabilities\tRatio of the decision\nIt has, as noticed hereinbefore, further been contended that various best judgment assessment passed by the Assessing Authority against some of the Appellants have been set aside in

Ashwin Mehta and Sudhir Mehta filed applications, within the prescribed period, before the Special Court praying for their de-notifications\tFacts\nHowever, by an order dated 14.July.2000, the said

decision\nThe question, however, before us is as to whether any contention which may not have a direct bearing with the question as to whether the Special Court could entertain their applications for de-notifications could be raised by way of defence\tRatio of the decision\nIt is no doubt true that the law of limitation bars a remedy but not a right\tRatio of the decision\nSee Bombay Dyeing &

Synthetics Ltd\tPrecedent\n2004 Indlaw SC 715 (supra), this Court observed: \"A statute of limitation bars a remedy and not a right\tPrecedent\nAlthough a remedy is barred, a defence can be raised\tPrecedent\nIn construing a special statute providing for limitation, consideration of plea of hardship is irrelevant\tPrecedent\nA special statute providing for special or no period of limitation must receive a liberal and broader construction and not a rigid or a narrow one\tPrecedent\nThe intent and purport of Parliament enacting the said Act furthermore must be given its full effect\tPrecedent\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that the provisions of the Limitation Act have no application, so far as directions required to be issued by the Special Court relating to the disposal of attached property, are concerned\tPrecedent\nAlthough, we do not intend to enter into the correctness or otherwise of the said contention of the Appellants at this stage, however, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that they being notified persons, all their properties would be deemed to be automatically attached as a consequent thereto\tRatio of the decision\nFor the said purpose, it is not necessary that they should be accused of commission of an offence as such\tRatio of the decision\nThe contention of the Appellants to the effect that their properties should have been attached only towards the liabilities incurred by the parties in respect of the transactions made during the Statutory Period, cannot be accepted as all the Appellants being notified, the attachment of the assets would be automatic\tRatio of the decision\nL.S. Synthetics Ltd. 2004 Indlaw SC 715 (supra\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, the contention of the Appellants that the properties held by them otherwise are sufficient to meet their liabilities was

the decision\nThe Custodian in a case of this nature may, however, show that the transactions entered into apparently by Harshad Mehta were intimately connected with acquisition of properties in the name of others\tRatio of the decision\nA transaction of Benami indisputably can be a subject matter of a lies in terms of S. 4(1) of the Act as and when such a question is raised, the same may have to be dealt with by the Special Court appropriately\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, nexus between several persons in dealing with the matter may be established by the Custodian\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact, however, remains that the copies of the documents, books of accounts and other records on the basis whereof the Auditors appointed by the Court filed their reports had not been shown to the Appellants herein, on the premise that they were in know of the things\tRatio of the decision\nAs the said question has not been gone into by the learned Judge, Special Court, it is necessary that the same be considered and appropriately dealt with\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants, however, raised the following contentions: (i) That the statement prepared by the Custodian and Exhibited as 'C' to his affidavit in rejoinder dated 1.October.2003 was based on material, at least, all of which were not connected to the Appellants as were pointed out before the Court\tArgument\nThe learned Special Judge has accepted the figures stated by the Custodian at face value without probing the basis on which the statement was prepared, even though the Appellants in their sur-rejoinder asserted that the figures in the statement were contrary to both the books of accounts drawn by them as also the Auditor's report\tArgument\nIn Para 14 of the sur-rejoinder, the Appellants denied the asset and liability position as arrived at by the Custodian\tArgument\nAccording to the Appellants, the Custodian has under-estimated the assets and exaggerated and overstated their liabilities\tArgument\nA triable issue had been raised and the Custodian's petition should have been converted into a suit\tArgument\nThis was not done\tArgument\nIn fact, according to the Appellants, there are gross errors in the material relied upon by the Custodian\tArgument\nThe said contention must be properly adjudged\tArgument\nSeveral charts have been filed before us by the Appellants to show: (i) liabilities have been exaggerated by the Custodian\tArgument\nNo credit for Rs\tArgument\n1227 crores released to revenue on interest are given by the Custodian\tArgument\nii) liabilities have been shown in relation to unperformed contracts\tArgument\nCredits not given for relief obtained from Income Tax\tArgument\nSubsequent to the filing of the present appeal in a large number of cases the revenue demands have been set aside\tArgument\nIt is open to the Appellants, herein to show that even if they continued to be notified, the Custodian was not right in clubbing all the individual members of the family as a single entity styled as Harshad Mehta Group\tRatio of the decision\nIt is interesting to note that the properties belonging to the mother of Harshad Mehta has since been released from attachment\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned Special Court, despite, such a contention having been raised by the Appellants in their affidavit in reply did not advert thereto\tRatio of the decision\nIt is furthermore not in dispute that pursuant to or in furtherance of the directions issued by the learned Special Court, the accounts of all entities, be it corporate or individual, were drawn up separately which approach had not been dis-approved by the Auditor appointed by the Special Court\tRatio of the decision\nEven in the rejoinder filed by the Custodian, e.g., paragraphs 14, 20, 21 and 22, before the Special Court, such contentions have been raised\tRatio of the decision\nA sur-rejoinder thereto was filed on 15.October.2003 and in paragraphs 1 to 6 thereof, the said statements were denied and disputed\tFacts\nOur attention has also been drawn to a letter dated 7.October.2003 addressed by all the Appellants to the Office of the Custodian wherein the attention of the Custodian was drawn to the fact that all the documents relied upon by him had not been permitted to be inspected and he was requested to forward a report prepared by the Chartered Accountants in respect of the individual addressors of the letters\tRatio of the decision\nThe said letter was replied by the Custodian by his letter dated 10.October.2003 wherein none of the queries contained in paragraphs 3 to 8 of the said letter was even attempted to be answered\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants, herein contended that the Custodian did not furnish the requisite particulars thereof and inspection was refused on the grounds stated therein\tArgument\nThe learned Special Court, in the impugned order, stated: (i\tRuling by Lower Court\nthe grand total of the admitted liability, thus, comes to Rs\tRuling by Lower Court\n7,279,127,317.15\tRuling by Lower Court\nthe amount of priority demand of Income Tax liabilities comes to Rs. 18,297,576,248\tRuling by Lower Court\nthe estimated value of the immovable properties of this group is Rs\tRuling by Lower Court\n184,030,038\tRuling by Lower Court\nThus, the total value of the assets as per the affidavit filed on behalf of the Custodian of Harshad Mehta Group is Rs\tRuling by Lower Court\n9,727,332,166.94\tRuling by Lower Court\nv\tRuling by Lower Court\nThus, taking into consideration the total of the decretal amount and the income-tax liability, it is clear that the total assets of Harshad Mehta group would be far below the liabilities\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn arriving at the said finding, no contention of the parties raised in their respective affidavits had been adverted to nor any material filed before it was analysed\tRatio of the decision\nIn our opinion, the learned Judge, Special Court should have analysed the respective contentions of the parties in greater details and in particular in regard to assets and liabilities of the separate entities and having regard to the contentions raised by them that they are not part of the Harshad Mehta Group and their individual liabilities can be met from the assets held and possessed by them separately\tRatio of the decision\nThe statement annexed to the affidavit of the Custodian showed individual break-up and in that view of the matter the net asset picture of each individual of the Appellants herein on individual basis and the effect thereof, in our opinion, should have received serious consideration at the hands of the learned Special Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe Custodian in terms of the directions issued by the learned Special Court had affirmed an affidavit putting on record the assets and liabilities of each of the members of the so-called Harshad Mehta Group on an individual basis\tRatio of the decision\nAllegedly, therein it was shown that the individuals had received large loans, advances, credits from the Harshad Mehta Group and there had been intermingling of the assets to the tune of crores of rupees\tRatio of the decision\nBefore us, Mr. Desai had filed a chart for showing the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe said chart, however, shows that at least Mrs. Deepika Mehta held assets more than her liabilities\tArgument\nMr. Desai contended that if interest is calculated, liabilities would be more than assets\tArgument\nBut, the said chart has been drawn up on the basis of the audited accounts, the correctness whereof is itself in dispute\tArgument\nBefore us a chart has been produced by the Appellants herein as regards Mrs. Deepika Mehta to show her liabilities payable as on 8th June, 1992 which are as under: \"Chart showing comparison of payables as on 8th June, 1992\tRatio of the decision\nWe, therefore, have not been given a clear picture as to the correctness or otherwise of the affidavit filed by the Custodian vis-a-vis the Books of Accounts which have been maintained by the Appellants themselves as well as the Auditor's Report\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned Judge merely accepted the figures mentioned in the affidavit of the Custodian and relied thereupon in the judgment without discussing the contentions and arguments raised on behalf of the Appellants, herein\tRatio of the decision\nWe, therefore, are of the opinion, in the interest of justice, that it is necessary to give another opportunity of hearing to the Appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that horrendous figures as regard the liabilities of Harshad Mehta have been projected before us but the same had been shown to be of the entire Group\tRatio of the decision\nIf the liabilities of the individual entities are not treated as that of the group, for one reason or the other, indisputably, liability of those who have nothing to do with the dealings of Harshad Mehta either in their individual capacities or as Directors of some company or otherwise must be dealt with separately\tRatio of the decision\nThe contention raised on behalf of the Appellants is that the Harshad Mehta should be considered to be sui generis and the Custodian may realize his dues from his personal assets as also of those with which he was concerned together with the assets of his front companies but such liability should not be fastened upon others who had nothing to do therewith\tArgument\nAs regards liabilities of Harshad Mehta, the Appellants contended that since his expiry in the year 2001 his legal interests are not being defended both in the court as well as before the revenue, as a result, liabilities have been foisted upon him a large part which is on account of interest and penalties\tArgument\nHis death has also forced upon him bankruptcy\tArgument\nOn the other hand, the contention of the Custodian is that the Appellants had not only taken huge loans or advances from Harshad Mehta in one capacity or the other but also even transactions and shares were made by Harshad Mehta on their behalf\tArgument\nFurther contention of the Custodian is that even Dr. Hitesh Mehta and Dr. Pratima Mehta have admitted that they had no knowledge about the transactions\tArgument\nThis may be so, but then the effect of the rival contentions was required to be gone into by the learned Special Court\tRatio of the decision\nA finding of fact arrived at upon discussing and analyzing the respective contentions could have gone a long way in assisting this Court in arriving at a correct conclusion\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned Judge proceeded on the basis that the assets and liabilities, joint and collective, of all those who are related with Harshad Mehta as also the corporate entities in which he was a Director or had some other interest must be considered as a group\tRatio of the decision\nEven in this behalf, it was necessary for the Special Judge to assign sufficient and cogent reasons\tRatio of the decision\nA question may further arise as to whether the learned Judge was correct in considering the individual liabilities of the notified parties as the liabilities of the group\tRatio of the decision\nIf those individuals, who had no connection with Harshad Mehta could not have been proceeded against for meeting the liabilities of Harshad Mehta jointly or severally, a clear finding was required to be arrived at\tRatio of the decision\nOnly because there had been large intermingling and flow of funds from Harshad Mehta and inter se within the group, the same by itself may not justify the conclusion that all of their assets were required to be sold irrespective of their individual involvement\tRatio of the decision\nIt was, thus, necessary for the learned Special Court to arrive at a firm conclusion as regard the involvement of the individuals with Harshad Mehta, if any, and the extent of his liability as such\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore, the question as regard liability of the parties should have been determined at the stage of Section 9-A of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants have contended that the Custodian had taken contradictory or inconsistent stand inasmuch as the liabilities of all the entities were treated to be joint liabilities of Harshad Mehta group\tArgument\nHe furthermore wanted to treat the liabilities of the notified entities also as their separate liabilities\tArgument\nHe has proceeded on the basis that even if the assets and liabilities of all individuals is taken on an individual basis, the liabilities would exceed assets in the case of each individual and corporate entity\tArgument\nIt had, however, never been the case of the Custodian that the examination of claims of all the notified parties is complete\tRatio of the decision\nIt does not appear that claims inter se between the entities within the so-called group had ever been taken into consideration\tRatio of the decision\nThe Custodian does not appear to have preferred claims before the Special Court on behalf of the largest lender on the so-called group against those he had to recover loans\tRatio of the decision\nSuch claims may also be preferred\tRatio of the decision\nThe Act confers wide power upon the Custodian and the learned Special Court and in that view of the matter, having regard to the principles of natural justice, the judgment and order of the learned Judge, Special Court should have furthermore been supported by

P.K. Abdulla [(1996) 7 SCC 668] 1996 Indlaw SC 3096, this Court making a distinction between decree-holder auction purchaser himself and a third party bona fide purchaser in an auction sale, observed : \"The ratio behind this distinction between a sale to a decree-holder and a sale to a stranger is that the court, as a matter of policy, will protect honest outsider purchasers at sales held in the execution of its decrees, although the sales may be subsequently set aside, when such purchasers are not parties to the suit\tPrecedent\nBut for such protection, the properties which are sold in court auctions would not fetch a proper price and the decree-holder himself would suffer\tPrecedent\nThe same consideration does not apply when the decree-holder is himself the purchaser and the decree in his favour is set aside\tPrecedent\nHe is a party to the litigation and is very much aware of the vicissitudes of litigation and needs no protection\tPrecedent\nWe, therefore, do not interfere with

Development Authority,even thereafter an amount of Rs.6.09 crores will remain payable by the Company,but the High Court failed to address such issue\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court though noticed that S.8 of the U.P.State Sugar Undertakings Acquisition Act,1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking,but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the U.P.Sugar Undertakings Acquisition Act,1971\tRatio of the decision\nany liability incurred by the

for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale\tRatio of the decision\nThe question arises as to

expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment\tPrecedent\nThis Court in the said case held: \"10.The crucial question is whether there can be any direction for interest on rental compensation once it is held that the same has to be paid within the time frame,notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation\tPrecedent\n11.It is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made\tPrecedent\nThough the inevitable conclusion is that the High Court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the Act,yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners\tPrecedent\nIt is,however,seen that the writ applications were filed long after the possession was taken\tPrecedent\nThis factor cannot be lost sight of while working out the equities\tPrecedent\nIt would,therefore,be appropriate if the appellants pay interest\tPrecedent\n6% from 1-4-2000 till

the Managing Director of a company,registered and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act,known as M/s\tFacts\nSundesh Springs Private Limited\tFacts\nIt was an exporter and held a valid licence therefor\tFacts\nThe company was to export products of alloy steel\tFacts\nUpon exporting of alloy steel,it was entitled to credits under the Duty Entitlement Pass Book (DEPB\tFacts\nScheme introduced by the Government of India with an object of encouraging exports\tFacts\nHe allegedly misdeclared both the value and description of goods upon procuring fake and false bills through one Prabhjot Singh\tFacts\nThe said Prabhjot Singh was said to have been operating three firms,viz\tFacts\nM/s\tFacts\nS.P.Industrial Corporation,M/s\tFacts\nAaysons (India) and M/s\tFacts\nP.J.Sales Corporation,Ludhiana\tFacts\nIt was allegedly found that non-alloy steel,bars,rods,etc.of value ranging from Rs.15/-to Rs.17/-per kg.were exported in the guise of alloy steel forgings,bars,rods,etc.by declaring their value thereof from Rs.110/-to Rs.150/-per kg.and the export proceeds over and above the actual price were being routed through Hawala Channel\tFacts\nThe officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) searched the factory as well as the residential premises of Appellant and that of Prabhjot Singh\tFacts\nVarious incriminating documents were recovered\tFacts\nAppellant and the said Prabhjot Singh made statements u/s.108 of the Customs Act\tFacts\nPrabhjot Singh allegedly admitted to have supplied fake bills to units owned and controlled by Appellant on commission basis without actual supply of the goods\tFacts\nIt was also found that Appellant had declared goods exported as \"alloy steel\" whereas after the tests conducted by Central Revenue Control Laboratory,they were found to be \"other than alloy steel\",i.e.,non-alloy\tFacts\nThe Consul (Economic),Consulate General of India at Dubai allegedly confirmed the existence of a parallel set of export invoices\tFacts\nInvoices with a higher value were presented before the Indian Customs Authorities with a view to avail DEPB incentives but in fact invoices with a lower value were presented for clearance\tFacts\nOn the aforementioned allegations,an order of detention was issued on 5.4.2005.Appellant moved for issuance of a writ of Habeas Corpus before the High Court of Judicature of Punjab and Haryana\tFacts\nThe said writ petition was dismissed by an order dated 23.11.2005 by a learned Single Judge\tFacts\nA letters patent appeal,concededly which was not maintainable,was filed thereagainst which was dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment\tFacts\nAlthough before the High Court,the principal ground urged on behalf of Appellant in questioning the legality or validity of the order of detention was unexplained delay in passing the order of detention which did not find favour with the High Court\tArgument\nBefore us,several other grounds,viz.,non placement of vital/ material documents before the detaining authority,non-supply of documents relied on or referred to in the order of detention as also non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority had been raised\tRatio of the decision\nIn the meantime admittedly the period of detention being over,Appellant had been set at large\tRatio of the decision\nHe was released from custody on 17.5.2006\tRatio of the decision\nThis appeal,however,has been pressed as a proceeding under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act,1976 (for short \"SAFEMA\"),has been initiated against Appellant\tStatute\nWe may first deal with the question of unexplained delay\tRatio of the decision\nIn this regard we may notice the following dates\tRatio of the decision\nOn 13.10.2003,Appellant was arrested\tFacts\nHe was discharged on bail on 6.1.2004.Several inquiries were conducted both inside and outside India\tFacts\nA report in relation to overseas inquiry was received on 12.5.2004.On 25.6.2004 proposal of detention was sent which was approved on 2.12.2004.On\tFacts\n20.12.2004,the authorities of the DRI stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not under scrutiny\tFacts\nFurthermore,the authorities of the DRI by a letter dated 28.02.2005 requested the Bank to defreeze the bank accounts of Appellants\tFacts\nThe order of detention was passed on 5.4.2005\tFacts\nThe learned Additional Solicitor General,who appeared on behalf of Respondent has drawn our attention to a long list of dates showing that searches were conducted and statements of a large number of persons had to be recorded\tArgument\nThe final order of detention was preceded not only on the basis of raids conducted in various premises,recording of statements of a large number of witnesses,carrying on intensive inquiries both within India and outside India,obtaining test reports from three different laboratories but also the fact that despite notices Appellant and his associates did not cooperate with the investigating authorities\tArgument\nThey initiated various civil proceedings from time to time,obtained various interim orders and,thus,delay in passing the order of detention cannot be said to have not been explained\tArgument\nLearned counsel would contend that keeping in view the nature and magnitude of an offence under COFEPOSA,a distinction must be made between an order of detention passed under COFEPOSA vis-a-vis other Acts as per the law laid down by this Court in Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah v\tArgument\nState of Gujarat and Others [(1988) 3 SCC 153 1988 Indlaw SC 71] and in that view of the matter the High Court must be held to have arrived at a correct decision\tArgument\nIndisputably,delay to some extent stands explained\tRatio of the decision\nBut,we fail to understand as to why despite the fact that the proposal for detention was made on 2.12.2004,the order of detention was passed after four months\tRatio of the decision\nWe must also notice that in the meantime on 20.12.2004,the authorities of the DRI had clearly stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not under the scrutiny stating: \"In our letter mentioned above,your office was requested not to issue the DEPB scripts to M/s\tRatio of the decision\nGirnar Impex Limited and M/s\tRatio of the decision\nSiri Amar Exports,only in respect of the pending application,if any,filed by these parties up to the date of action i.e.11.10.2003 as the past exports were under scrutiny being doubtful as per the intelligence received in this office\tRatio of the decision\nThis office never intended to stop the export incentives occurring to the parties,after the date of action i.e.11.10.2003.In the civil,your office letter\tRatio of the decision\nNo.B.L.-2/Misc\tRatio of the decision\nAm-2003/Ldh dated 17.05.2004 is being referred,which is not received in this office\tRatio of the decision\nYou are,therefore,requested to supply photocopy of the said letter to the bearer of this letter as this letter is required for filing reply to the Hon'ble Court\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore,as noticed hereinbefore,the authorities of the DRI by a letter dated 28.02.2005 requested the Bank to defreeze the bank accounts of Appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe said documents,in our opinion,were material\tRatio of the decision\nIt was,therefore,difficult to appreciate why order of detention could not be passed on the basis of the materials gathered by them\tRatio of the decision\nIt is no doubt true that if the delay is sufficiently explained,the same would not be a ground for quashing an order of detention under COFEPOSA,but as in this case a major part of delay remains unexplained\tRatio of the decision\nWe may also place on record that Sen.,J.in Rajendrakumar Natvarlal Shah 1988 Indlaw SC 71 (supra),while laying down various stages of the procedures leading to an order of detention,opined that rule as to unexplained delay in taking action is not inflexible and a detention under COFEPOSA may be considered from a different angle\tPrecedent\nThe question came up for consideration recently in Rajinder Arora v\tPrecedent\nUnion of India and Others [(2006) 4 SCC 796 2006 Indlaw SC 87] wherein it has been held: \"Furthermore no explanation whatsoever has been offered by the Respondent as to why the order of detention has been issued after such a long time\tPrecedent\nThe said question has also not been examined by the authorities before issuing the order of detention\tPrecedent\nThe question as regard delay in issuing the order of detention has been held to be a valid ground for quashing an order of detention by this Court in T.D.Abdul Rahman v\tPrecedent\nState of Kerala and others [AIR 1990 SC 225 1989 Indlaw SC 205] stating: \"The conspectus of the above decisions can be summarised thus: The question whether the prejudicial activities of a person necessitating to pass an order of detention is proximate to the time when the order is made or the live-link between the prejudicial activities and the purpose of detention is snapped depends on the facts and circumstances of each case\tPrecedent\nNo hard and fast rule can be precisely formulated that would be applicable under all circumstances and no exhaustive guidelines can be laid down in that behalf\tPrecedent\nIt follows that the test of proximity is not a rigid or mechanical test by merely counting number of months between the offending acts and the order of detention\tPrecedent\nHowever,when there is undue and long delay between the prejudicial activities and the passing of detention order,the court has to scrutinise whether the detaining authority has satisfactorily examined such a delay and afforded a tenable and reasonable explanation as to why such a delay has occasioned,when called upon to answer and further the court has to investigate whether the causal connection has been broken in the circumstances of each case\tPrecedent\nSimilarly when there is unsatisfactory and unexplained delay between the date of order of detention and the date of securing the arrest of the detenu,such a delay would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority leading to a legitimate inference that the detaining authority was not really and genuinely satisfied as regards the necessity for detaining the detenu with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner\tPrecedent\nThe delay caused in this case in issuing the order of detention has not been explained\tPrecedent\nIn fact,no reason in that behalf whatsoever has been assigned at all\tPrecedent\nDelay,as is well known,at both stages has to be explained\tRatio of the decision\nThe court is required to consider the question having regard to the overall picture\tRatio of the decision\nWe may notice that in Sk\tPrecedent\nSerajul v\tPrecedent\nState of West Bengal [(1975) 2 SCC 78 1974 Indlaw SC 475],this Court opined: \"There was thus delay at both stages and this delay,unless satisfactorily explained,would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the District Magistrate,Burdwan recited in the order of detention\tPrecedent\nIt would be reasonable to assume that if the District Magistrate of Burdwan was really and genuinely satisfied after proper application of mind to the materials before him that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner,he would have acted with greater promptitude both in making the order of detention as also in securing the arrest of the petitioner,and the petitioner would not have been allowed to remain at large for such a long period of time to carry on his nefarious activities\tPrecedent\nIn Abdul Salam Alias Thiyyan S/o Thiyyan Mohammad,Detenu No.962,General Prison,Trivandrum v\tPrecedent\nUnion of India and Others [(1990) 3 SCC 15 1990 Indlaw SC 994] whereupon the learned Additional Solicitor General has placed strong reliance,this Court found that there had been potentiality or likelihood of prejudicial activities and,thus,or mere delay,as long as,it is explained,the court may not strike down the detention\tPrecedent\nIn the instant case,we have noticed hereinbefore that the authorities of DRI themselves categorically stated that the activities of Appellant after 11.10.2003 were not in question and in fact all the bank accounts were defreezed\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough learned Additional Solicitor General may be correct in his submissions that ordinarily we should not exercise our discretionary jurisdiction u/art.136 of the Constitution of India by allowing Appellant to raise new grounds but,in our opinion,we may have to do so as an order of detention may have to be considered from a different angle\tRatio of the decision\nIt may be true that the period of detention is over\tRatio of the decision\nIt may further be true that Appellant had remained in detention for the entire period but it is one thing to say that the writ of Habeas Corpus in this circumstances cannot issue but it is another thing to say that an order of detention is required to be quashed so as to enable the detainee to avoid his civil liabilities under SAFEMA as also protect his own reputation\tRatio of the decision\nIn a case of this nature,we do not think,in view of the admitted facts,that we would not permit Appellant to raise the said questions\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as the question of non-placement of material documents before the detaining authority is concerned,we may notice the following dates: (i\tFacts\nBy a letter dated 5.7.2002,the authorities of DRI stated that Appellant stood exonerated for earlier years after detailed examination\tFacts\nii\tFacts\nBy a letter dated 20.12.2004,the authorities of DRI stated that transactions after 11.10.2003 were not under scrutiny and by letters dated 28.2.2005 and 7.3.2005,the bank accounts of Appellant were defreezed\tFacts\niii\tFacts\nBy reason of the Civil Court by orders dated 7.5.2004 and 31.5.2004,the bank accounts of M/s\tFacts\nGirnar and Shri Amar were defreezed\tFacts\niv\tFacts\nBy an order dated 13.8.2004,the Tribunal ordered release of goods\tFacts\nv) By orders dated 31.8.2004 and 28.10.2004,the Civil Judge directed release of documents to Appellant\tFacts\nvi\tFacts\nBy an order dated 18.11.2004,the Civil Court issued contempt notice to the authorities of DRI for non-release of documents and the authorities of DRI made a statement before the court that the documents are being returned\tFacts\nWe have noticed hereinbefore that learned Additional Solicitor General contended that Appellant obstructed the proceedings by initiating various civil litigations\tRatio of the decision\nBut,indisputably,those documents involving the civil court proceedings were not placed before the detaining authority\tRatio of the decision\nIf the same had not been done,not only the delay,in issuing the order of detention stood unexplained but also thereby the order itself would become vitiated\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore,the civil court proceedings were over on 19.11.2004\tRatio of the decision\nEvidently,the detaining authority did not take immediate steps to detain Appellant\tRatio of the decision\nWhy the documents pertaining to the proceedings of the Civil Court had not been placed before the detaining authority has not been explained\tRatio of the decision\nOn their own showing,Respondents admit that they were relevant documents\tRatio of the decision\nThe question has been considered by this Court in Rajinder Arora 2006 Indlaw SC 87 (supra) stating: \"Admittedly,furthermore,the status report called for from the Customs Department has not been taken into consideration by the competent authorities\tPrecedent\nA Division Bench of this Court in K.S.Nagamuthu v\tPrecedent\nState of Tamil Nadu & Ors.[2005 (9) SCALE 534 2005 Indlaw SC 748] struck down an order of detention on the ground that the relevant material had been withheld from the detaining authority; which in that case was a letter of the detenu retracting from confession made by him\tPrecedent\nIn P.Saravanan v\tPrecedent\nState of T.N.and Others [(2001) 10 SCC 212],it was stated: \"When we went through the grounds of detention enumerated by the detaining authority we noticed that there is no escape from the conclusion that the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority was the cumulative result of all the grounds mentioned therein\tPrecedent\nIt is difficult for us to say that the detaining authority would have come to the subjective satisfaction solely on the strength of the confession attributed to the petitioner dated 7-11-1999,particularly because it was retracted by him\tPrecedent\nIt is possible to presume that the confession made by the co-accused Sowkath Ali would also have contributed to the final opinion that the confession made by the petitioner on 7-11-1999 can safely be relied on\tPrecedent\nWhat would have been the position if the detaining authority was apprised of the fact that Sowkath Ali had retracted his confession,is not for us to make a retrospective judgment at this distance of time\tPrecedent\nIn Ahamed Nassar v\tPrecedent\nState of Tamil Nadu and Others [(1999) 8 SCC 473 1999 Indlaw SC 778],this Court opined: \"The question is not whether the second part of the contents of those letters was relevant or not but whether they were placed before the detaining authority for his consideration\tPrecedent\nThere could be no two opinions on it\tPrecedent\nIt contains the very stand of the detenu of whatever worth\tPrecedent\nWhat else would be relevant if not this\tPrecedent\nIt may be that the detaining authority might have come to the same conclusion as the sponsoring authority but its contents are relevant which could not be withheld by the sponsoring authority\tPrecedent\nThe letter dated 19-4-1999 reached the sponsoring authority and reached well within time for it being placed before the detaining authority\tPrecedent\nThere is an obligation cast on the sponsoring authority to place it before the detaining authority,which has not been done\tPrecedent\nEven the letter dated 23-4-1999 which reached the Secretary concerned at 3.00 p.m.on 26-4-1999 was much before the formal detention order dated 28-4-1999.The Secretary concerned was obliged to place the same before the detaining authority\tPrecedent\nThe respondent authority was not right in not placing it as it contains not only what is already referred to in the bail application dated 1-4-1999 but something more\tPrecedent\nThe statements of Appellant and Prabhjot Singh were noticed by the detaining authority\tPrecedent\nIt had specifically been referred to in extenso in the order of detention\tPrecedent\nIt is,however,stated that the records were tampered with at the instance of Appellant\tPrecedent\nThe self-inculpatory statements of Appellant and that of Prabhjot Singh were said to have been taken off the file\tPrecedent\nRespondents contended that on first information report was registered against Appellant as also one sepoy Narender Singh\tPrecedent\nBut the said information report was registered only on 6.4.2005 and not prior to the date of order of detention\tPrecedent\nIn paragraph 36 of the order of detention,the detaining authority stated: \"In view of the facts mentioned above,I have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that you have through your acts of omission and commission indulged in prejudicial activities as narrated above\tFacts\nConsidering the nature and gravity of the offence,the well planned manner in which you have engaged yourself in such prejudicial activities and your role therein as brought out above,all of which reflect your high potentiality and propensity to indulge in such prejudicial activities in future,I am satisfied that there is a need to prevent you from indulging in such prejudicial activities in future by detention under COFEPOSA ACT,1974 with a view to preventing you from smuggling goods in future\tFacts\nWe have been taken through the order of detention\tRatio of the decision\nThe statements of Appellant and the said Prabhjot Singh were recorded therein in extenso\tRatio of the decision\nRecording of such statement must have been made from the xeroxed copies of such documents which were available with the detaining authority\tRatio of the decision\nThe self-inculpatory statements of Appellant as also Prabhjot Singh purported to have been made in terms of S.108 of the Customs Act were required to be considered before the order of detention could be passed\tRatio of the decision\nThe same was not done\tRatio of the decision\nThe original of such documents might not been available with the detaining authority but admittedly the xeroxed copies were\tRatio of the decision\nIt has not been denied or disputed that even the xeroxed copies of the said documents had not been supplied to the detenue\tRatio of the decision\nIt may be true that Appellant in his representation dated 14.06.2005 requested for showing him the original documents referred to or mentioned in the grounds of detention but then at least the xeroxed copies thereof should have been made available to him\tRatio of the decision\nLearned Additional Solicitor General submitted that due to non-supply of documents which were not vital or have merely been referred to as incidental,the order of detention may not become vitiated as was been held by this Court in Kamarunnissa v\tPrecedent\nUnion of India and Another\tRatio of the decision\n1991) 1 SCC 128 1990 Indlaw SC 85].The said decision was rendered in a different fact situation\tPrecedent\nIn the said decision,this Court stated the law,thus: \" If,merely an incidental reference is made to some part of the investigation concerning a co-accused in the grounds of detention which has no relevance to the case set up against the detenus it is difficult to understand how the detenus could contend that they were denied the right to make an effective representation\tPrecedent\nIt is not sufficient to say that the detenus were not supplied the copies of the documents in time on demand but it must further be shown that the non-supply has impaired the detenu's right to make an effective and purposeful representation\tPrecedent\nDemand of any or every document,however irrelevant it may be for the concerned detenu,merely on the ground that there is a reference thereto in the grounds of detention,cannot vitiate an otherwise legal detention order\tPrecedent\nNo hard and fast rule can be laid down in this behalf but what is essential is that the detenu must show that the failure to supply the documents before the meeting of the Advisory Board had impaired or prejudiced his right,however slight or insignificant it may be\tPrecedent\nIn the present case,except stating that the documents were not supplied before the meeting of the Advisory Board,there is no pleading that it had resulted in the impairment of his right nor could counsel for the petitioners point out any such prejudice\tPrecedent\nWe are,therefore,of the opinion that the view taken by the Bombay High Court in this behalf is unassailable\tPrecedent\nWhat is,therefore,relevant was as to whether the documents were material\tFacts\nIf the documents were material so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his constitutional as also statutory right,non-supply thereof would vitiate the order of detention\tFacts\nIt is a trite law that all documents which are not material are not necessary to be supplied\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is necessary to be supplied is the relevant and the material documents,but,thus,all relevant documents must be supplied so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his fundamental right u/art.22(5) of the Constitution of India\tRatio of the decision\nRight to make an effective representation is also a statutory right.[See Sunila Jain v\tRatio of the decision\n2006) 3 SCC 321 2006 Indlaw SC 65\tRatio of the decision\nIn this case,the statements of Appellant and Prabhjot Singh,in our opinion,were material\tRatio of the decision\nThey could not have been withheld\tRatio of the decision\nIf original of the said documents were not available,xeroxed copies thereof could have been made available to him\tRatio of the decision\nThe detaining authority moreover while relying on the said documents in one part of the order of detention could not have stated in another part that he was not relying thereupon\tRatio of the decision\nThe very fact that he had referred to the said statements in ex tenso is itself a pointer to the fact that he had relied upon the said documents\tRatio of the decision\nEven in the earlier part of the impugned order of detention,i.e.detaining authority appears to have drawn his own conclusions\tRatio of the decision\nIn view of our findings aforementioned,it is not necessary to consider the contention raised by Mr\tRuling by Present Court\nMukul Rohtagi that order of detention suffers from non-application of mind\tRuling by Present Court\nThe judgment of the High Court,therefore,cannot be sustained\tRuling by Present Court\nIt is set aside accordingly and the order of detention passed against Appellant is quashed\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeal is allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nNo costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

Act,1999 dealt with opposition to a patent vides S.25.At that time appeals against decisions made by the Controller pertaining to \"pre-grant oppositions\" under S.25 were maintainable before the High Court u/s.116(2) of the Indian Patents Act,1970\tFacts\nWe quote herein below Ss.25 and 116 as it stood in the year 2000 under the Patents (Amendment) Act,1999 which read as under: \"S.25.Opposition

25,Section 28\" shall be substituted\tStatute\nthis section was not brought into force till 2.4.2007\tStatute\nIn short,by the Patents (Amendment) Act,2005,for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the Patent Law between \"opposition to the pre-grant\" and \"opposition to the post-grant of patent\".This was the major structural change in the Patent Law\tRatio of the decision\nSimilarly,under the Patents (Amendment) Act,2005,appeal was restricted to the post-grant opposition orders and that appeal lay before the Appellate Board and not to the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nHere also,S.25 of the Patents Act,1970 as amended by Patents (Amendment) Act,2005\tRatio of the decision\nwhich refers to \"pre-grant opposition\" and \"post-grant opposition\") was brought into force on and from 1.1.2005 whereas amended Section 117A by which appeal was provided for against post-grant opposition order was not brought into force till 2.4.2007.One more aspect needs to be mentioned\tRatio of the decision\nAs stated,vide Patents (Amendment\tRatio of the decision\nAct,2005,a dichotomy was brought in between pre-grant and post-grant opposition orders\tRatio of the decision\nw.e.f.1.1.2005.But when it came to filing of first appeal for some unknown reasons,the amended Section 117A (which provided for only one statutory appeal and that too against post-grant orders passed by the Controller) was not brought into force\tRatio of the decision\nThe result is that although the Legislature intended to provide for only one statutory appeal to the Appellate Board,by reason of S.61 of the Patents (Amendment) Act,2005 not being brought into force till 2.4.07 a strange situation developed\tRatio of the decision\nThe Legislature intended to provide for only one statutory appeal to the Appellate Board but by not bringing S.61 into force till 2.4.07,appeals filed during the interregnum,as in this case,became vulnerable and liable to be dismissed as misconceived as is contended by the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThis is the controversy which needs to be resolved in this case\tRatio of the decision\nOn 19.10.2006 when FAO No.293/06 was filed in the High Court,Chapter XIX of the parent Act as amended vide Patents (Amendment\tRatio of the decision\nAct,1999 continued to be in operation notwithstanding the enactment of the Patents\tRatio of the decision\nAmendment) Act,2002 and the Patents (Amendment\tRatio of the decision\nAct,2005 as the amended Ss.116 and 117A were brought into force only vide Notification dated 2.4.07.One more point needs to be noted\tRatio of the decision\nSection 117G of the  principal Act was substituted vide Patents (Amendment) Act,2005.It reads as under: \"Section 117G.Transfer of pending proceedings to Appellate Board.-All cases of appeals against any order or decision of the Controller and all cases pertaining to revocation of patent other than on a counter-claim in a suit for infringement and rectification of register pending before any High Court,shall be transferred to the Appellate Board from such date as may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette and the Appellate Board may proceed with the matter either de novo or from the stage it was so transferred\tStatute\nOn reading amended Section 117G it becomes clear that all appeals against any order or decision of the Controller had to be transferred to the Appellate Board from such date as may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette\tRatio of the decision\nThis amended Section 117G was also brought into force vide Notification dated 3.4.2007.Under Notes on Clauses attached to the Statement of Objects and Reasons,it has been clarified,vide cl.62\tRatio of the decision\nthat amended S.117 G is consequential to the enforcement of the jurisdiction of the Appellate Board u/s.64 which results to revocation of patent\tRatio of the decision\nVide cl.47 of Notes on Clauses attached to the Statement of Objects and Reasons,it has been clarified that S.64 is also amended vide Patents (Amendment) Act,2005 to confer wider jurisdiction on the Appellate Board in matters of revocation of patent,therefore,amended Section 117G which is brought into force only from 3.4.2007 dealt with transfer of pending proceedings from the High Court to the Appellate Board\tRatio of the decision\nThe question which arises for determination in this batch of civil appeals is : whether FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 filed by respondent no.3 herein in the High Court were liable to be dismissed\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to the appellant,with the change in S.25 brought about by Patents (Amendment) Act,2005,a dichotomy was introduced in the Patents Act,1970.According to the appellant,that dichotomy was between \"pre-grant opposition\" and \"post-grant opposition\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to the appellant,this was a structural change in the principal Act\tArgument\nAccording to the appellant,on 23.8.06 the Controller rejected its \"pre-grant opposition\" and on that day \"post-grant opposition\" avenue was open to respondent no.3 vide S.25(2).According to the appellant,under the amended S.25 on rejection of \"pre-grant opposition\" it was open to respondent\tArgument\nno.3 to move an application opposing grant of patent under S.25(2).The patent was granted to the appellant on 22.9.06.According to the appellant,it was open to respondent no.3 to challenge the grant of patent by making \"post-grant opposition\" under S.25(2) from which an appeal was maintainable to the Appellate Board\tArgument\nThis was not done\tArgument\nFurther,according to the appellant,\"pre-grant opposition\" was filed by respondent no.3 under S.25(1) on 21.3.05.According to the appellant,though the Patents (Amendment) Act,2005,amended S.25 by enacting the amendment on 4.4.05 the said amendment was brought into force w.e.f.1.1.2005 and,therefore,it was open to respondent no.3 to challenge the grant of patent by invoking S.25(2) of the Patents Act,1970.According to the appellant,with the change in the structure of the Act providing for only one statutory appeal and that too only against the order granting patent under S.25(4),the appeal filed by respondent no.3 against pre-grant opposition order was not maintainable on 19.10.06 by which time,as stated above,S.25 stood restructured providing for a dichotomy between \"pre-grant opposition\" and \"post-grant opposition\tArgument\nOn the other hand,on behalf of respondent no.3,it has been urged that on 19.10.06 it had filed an appeal in the High Court under unamended S.116 of the parent Act; that,even though S.25 stood restructured w.e.f.1.1.05 on account of absence of notification bringing the amended law into force,Ss.116 and 117A (as amended) providing appeal to the Appellate Board came into force only with effect from 2.4.07 and,therefore,according to the said respondent,its first appeal being FAO No.293/06 continued to be governed by the law as it stood on 19.10.06 (on which date appeal to the High Court was maintainable); that,on 23.8.06 the \"pre-grant opposition\",filed by respondent no.3,stood rejected\tArgument\nHowever,on that date appeal against pre-grant opposition order was maintainable,under Section 116,to the High Court and,therefore,there is no merit in the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant that the first appeal filed by respondent no.3 was misconceived; that,it is true that S.25 got restructured w.e.f.1.1.2005,however,such restructuring did not obliterate the first appeal filed by respondent no.3 on 19.10.2006\tRatio of the decision\nand lastly it was argued on behalf respondent no.3 that the appellant had filed its application for grant of patent on 14.6.2000,it was notified on 20.11.04,however,respondent no.3 had filed its \"pre-grant opposition\" under S.25(1) on 21.3.05 when the Patents (Amendment) Act,2005 was not promulgated (it was promulgated on 4.4.05) and,therefore,according to respondent no.3 its \"pre-grant opposition\" filed on 21.3.05 was valid and proper as respondent no.3 could not have invoked S.25(2) proceedings on that day,namely,21.3.05 as the law stood enacted bringing in S.25(2) only on 4.4.05.In the peculiar circumstances of this case it was urged on behalf of respondent no.3 that no interference is called for by this Court in this batch of civil appeals\tArgument\nAs stated above,quite often the commencement of an Act is postponed to some specific future date or to such date as the Appropriate Government may,by notification in the Official Gazette,appoint\tRatio of the decision\nAt times provision is made for appointment of different dates for coming into force of different parts of the same Act\tRatio of the decision\nAn Act cannot be said to commence or to be in force unless it is brought into operation by legislative enactment or by the exercise of authority by a delegate empowered to bring it into operation\tRatio of the decision\nApplying the above tests to the present case,we find that by Patents (Amendment) Act,2005 for the first time a dichotomy was inserted in the Patent Law by providing vide S.25(1) for \"opposition to pre-grant\" and vide S.25 (2) for \"opposition to post-grant\" of patent\tRatio of the decision\nBy reason of Patents (Amendment) Act,2005,the kind of opposition available under the said 1970 Act is different from what existed earlier\tRatio of the decision\nPreviously,there was no \"post-grant opposition\".Previously,the only provision of challenge by an interested party was a \"pre-grant\" challenge under S.25 (1) as it then stood\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the Courts had evolved the 'rule of caution' as the patent had not faced any challenge at the hands of interested parties\tRatio of the decision\nThere is,however,a radical shift due to incorporation of S.25(2) where an interested party is granted the right to challenge the patent after its grant\tRatio of the decision\nThe ground of challenge under S.25(1) is identical to S.25(2) of the said 1970 Act\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,S.25(1) is wider than S.25(2) as the latter is available only to a \"person aggrieved\".The main difference between S.25(1) and S.25(2),as brought about by Patents (Amendment\tRatio of the decision\nAct,2005,is that even after a patent is granted,\"post-grant opposition\" can be filed under S.25 (2) for a period of one year\tRatio of the decision\nThe reason is obvious\tRatio of the decision\nIn relation to patents that are of recent origin,a higher scrutiny is necessary\tRatio of the decision\nThis is the main rationale underlying S.25(2) of the said 1970 Act\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the Legislature intended an appeal under Section 117A(2) to the Appellate Board from any decision,order or direction of the Controller,inter alia,under S.25(4) [which refers to the power of the Controller to maintain,amend or revoke the patent\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,the Legislature intended to provide for two types of scrutiny followed by one statutory appeal to the Appellate Board against \"post-grant proceedings\".The Legislature intended to have a dichotomy between \"pre-grant opposition\" and \"post-grant opposition\".However,the Legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory appeal against grant of patent\tRatio of the decision\nThe Legislature intended to obliterate appeal from \"pre-grant proceedings\",which existed earlier\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,it was left to the Executive to bring the enacted law into force vide notification\tRatio of the decision\nFor some unknown reasons,the amended Ss.116 and 117A(2) were not brought into force till 2.4.07 whereas the concept of \"pre-grant\" and \"post-grant\" oppositions were brought into force w.e.f.1.1.2005.This is where the legislative intent got defeated during the interregnum\tRatio of the decision\nIt is during this interregnum that respondent no.3 filed its FAO No.293/06 in the High Court under Section 116,as\tRatio of the decision\nit stood on 19.10.06 under the Patents (Amendment) Act,1999.On that date,the amended Section 117A,suggested by Patents (Amendment) Act,2005,was not brought into force\tRatio of the decision\nOn 19.10.06 the old law prevailed under which an appeal lay before the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nRespondent no.3,in both the cases,preferred first appeals to the High Court u/s.116 as it then stood\tRatio of the decision\nThey are FAO No.292/06 and FAO\tRatio of the decision\nNo.293/06.We have to decide the fate of these pending appeals\tRatio of the decision\nOne more aspect needs to be mentioned\tRatio of the decision\nUnder the Patents (Amendment) Act,2005,appeal is provided to the Appellate Board against the order of the Controller under S.25(4).However,that statutory appeal is maintainable only in \"post-grant opposition\" proceedings whereas respondent no.3 herein has instituted first appeals under the law then prevailing,challenging the Order rejecting \"pre-grant opposition\" dated 23.8.06\tRatio of the decision\nTaking into account the complexities involved in this case,on account of a hiatus created by reason of the law not being brought into force in time,we are of the view that the first appeals,filed by respondent no.3 in the High Court being FAO\tRatio of the decision\nNo.292/06 and FAO\tRatio of the decision\nNo.293/06,would remain in the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe said appeals would be heard and disposed of by the High Court in accordance with law u/s.116 of the said 1970 Act as it stood on 19.10.06.The High Court will hear and decide the validity of the Order passed by the Controller dated 23.8.06 rejecting \"pre-grant opposition\" filed by respondent\tRatio of the decision\nno.3.We are informed that there are hardly one or two matters of this nature which are pending\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,we are of the view that respondent\tRatio of the decision\nno.3 cannot be let without remedy\tRatio of the decision\nIn the special circumstances of this case,particularly when after 2.4.07 appeals against orders rejecting \"pre-grant opposition\" are not maintainable and particularly when FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 were filed by respondent no.3 prior to 2.4.07 under the old law,we are of the view that these two appeals shall be heard and decided by the High Court in accordance with law\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellate Board after 2.4.07 is entitled to hear appeals only arising from orders passed by the Controller under S.25(4),i.e.,in cases of orders passed in \"post-grant opposition\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,there is no point in transferring the pending FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 to the Appellate Board which has no authority to decide matters concerning \"pre-grant opposition\".Moreover,it may be noted that even Section 117G,which refers to transfer of pending proceedings to the Appellate Board,is also brought into force vide Notification dated 3.4.07.Keeping in mind the peculiar nature of the problem in hand,we are of the view that ends of justice\tRatio of the decision\nwould be sub served if the High Court is directed to hear and decide the appeals bearing FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 in accordance with law as it then stood,i.e.,u/s.116 under Patents\tRatio of the decision\nAmendment) Act,1999 against Orders passed by the Controller in \"pre-grant opposition\" proceedings\tRatio of the decision\nAccordingly,the two Civil Appeals,filed by the appellant herein,stand disposed of with no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal disposed of\tRuling by Present Court\n"

            "text": "This appeal by special leave has been preferred by Tata Consultancy Engineers against an award dated 20th December,1978 of the Industrial Tribunal,Maharashtra,Bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits\tFacts\nTata Consultant Engineers,at its inception,was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of Tata Sons Limited\tFacts\nIt functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry,and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade\tFacts\nIts work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen\tFacts\nOut of 665 employees at Bombay,the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306.These workmen are members of the Tata Consultant Employees Union\tFacts\nThey served a Charter of Demands in July,1974,on the appellant,and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless,the State Government made a reference of the dispute under s.10(1) (d),Industrial Tribunal,Maharashtra for adjudication\tFacts\nThe Reference was numbered I.T.No.292 of 1975\tFacts\nThe Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments\tFacts\nIt was urged that the Efficiency Bar,as a feature of the wage scales,should be removed\tFacts\nThe dearness allowance,it was claimed,should be granted on a slab system\tFacts\nThe claim of the Union was resisted by the appellant,who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region-cum-industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the Union were accepted\tFacts\nReference was made to the political uncertainty in Iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant's business in jeopardy and to various other factors,peculiar to an engineering consultancy business,beyond the appellant's control\tFacts\nThere was fierce competition also,it was asserted,from other similar organisations\tFacts\nThe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised\tFacts\nThere was no separate dearness allowance until January,1977 when it was introduced for the first time\tFacts\nHouse rent allowance was also paid\tFacts\nDearness allowance became payable at 10% of the basic wage subject to a minimum of Rs.50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary\tFacts\nNothing those facts,the Tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant,an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years,there was definite need for revising the wage scales\tFacts\nIt was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living\tFacts\nThe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant\tFacts\nIn proceeding to revise the wage structure the Tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process,the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill,and the prevailing wage structure on an industry-cum-region basis\tFacts\nWage scale statements were filed by the parties before the Tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but\tFacts\nin the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force,the extent of their business,the financial position for some years,the capital invested,the precise nature of the business,the position regarding reserves,dividends declared and future prospects of the company,the Tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns\tFacts\nHolding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry-cum-region basis,the Tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden in this connection,it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of Tata Sons Limited and had no \"functional integrality\" with the other divisions\tFacts\nHaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the Union would result in an increased burden of Rs.7 crores,a burden which would dry up the appellant's resources and would be impossible for it to bear\tFacts\nThe Union modified its demands but even the modified terms,according to the Tribunal,appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of Rs.1.70 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain\tFacts\nThe particular character of the appellant,that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern,was taken into account and it was observed that unlike a manufacturing business there was little scope for diversification in the case of an engineering consultancy\tFacts\nNonetheless,the Tribunal observed,there was every reason to expect that the appellant would be able to earn sound profits in the future,and the instability in its business activities occasioned by the turbulent political situation in Iran,would be,it was expected,compensated by contracts secured in different developing countries\tFacts\nFor the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant,the Tribunal followed Unichem Laboratories v\tFacts\nTheir Workmen 1972 Indlaw SC 18(1) where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation,development rebate and depreciation\tFacts\nIt decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity\tFacts\nRevising the figures on that basis,it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at Rs.26.69 lakhs\tFacts\nThe Tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided \"to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category\tFacts\nIt also observed that the category of Draughtsmen needed a special increase\tFacts\nBut it rejected the demand of the Union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system,because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant's financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage\tFacts\nTaking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the Union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid,the Tribunal considered it fair,in paragraph 23 of the award,to give a flat increase of Rs.150/-in the category of Draughtsmen and Rs.100/-in the case of other categories\tFacts\nIt rejected the demand of the Union for abolishing the Efficiency Bar,but the span of 15 years for earning increment was expanded in some grades to 20 years and some adjustments were also made in specific grades\tFacts\nThe Tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales,senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service\tFacts\nTaking all these factors into consideration,it made an award dated 20th December,1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages\tFacts\nThe Tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance,and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance\tFacts\nThe revised wage scales,the Tribunal directed,should take effect retrospectively from 1st January,1976.It also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service\tFacts\nTwo days after the award was made,an application was made by the Union stating: \"In the said award,your Honour has observed,at the end of para 22,\"In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay,I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance\tFacts\nFurther,it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs.150/-to each draughtsman and Rs.100/-to all other workmen in their basic pay\tFacts\nHowever,this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission\tRatio of the decision\nThe Union prayed that the position may be clarified and the award corrected accordingly\tFacts\nOn the same date,the Tribunal disposed of the application by the following order: \"There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs.150/-to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and of Rs.100/-to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award\tFacts\nThe same has been made clear in paragraph\tRuling by Lower Court\nNo.23,but it appears that the words \"to each employee\" after the figure \"Rs.150/-\" were omitted\tRuling by Lower Court\nSimilarly,the same words \"to each employee\" after the figure \"100\" were omitted\tRuling by Lower Court\nWhen the award is sent for publication,a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures Rs.150/-and Rs.100/-be added\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz.to grant flat increase of Rs.150/-and of Rs.100/-to the employees in the category of Draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted (vide Ex\tRuling by Lower Court\nC-51).The fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee\tRuling by Lower Court\nI do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award\tRuling by Lower Court\nSince the award has been already signed,I do not think anything further can be added to this award\tRuling by Lower Court\nSd/-K.N.Wani INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNAL\tFacts\nIn this appeal,the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field,but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only\tArgument\nOne is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales,and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of Rs.150/-in the category of Draughtsmen and Rs.100/-in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd December,1978\tArgument\nThe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave,Civil Appeal No.2300 of 1979,in which they have challenged the rejection by the Tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which,they contend,should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount\tFacts\nConsidering the appeal of Tata Consulting Engineers first,the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the Tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and,in any event,in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st January,1976\tArgument\nWe have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention,but after giving careful thought to the matter,I think there is ample justification for what the Tribunal did\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter\tRatio of the decision\nNo dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time\tRatio of the decision\nThe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and,as the Tribunal has found,the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost\tRatio of the decision\nDuring all these years,the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits; nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant's growing prosperity\tRatio of the decision\nThe Charter of Demands was presented by the Union in July,1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the State Government made the reference to the Industrial Tribunal in 1975.The Tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales\tRatio of the decision\nThey are considerations which cannot be ignored\tRatio of the decision\nAccordingly,the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected\tRatio of the decision\nThe challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious\tRatio of the decision\nIt is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of Rs.150/-to each workman in the case of Draughtsman and Rs.100/-to each workman in the case of other categories,a result wholly unwarranted,it is said,by the intent of the original award and,therefore,falling beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal\tArgument\nIn making the application of 22nd\tStatute\nDecember,1978,the Union invoked the jurisdiction of the\tStatute\nTribunal under rule 31 of the Industrial Disputes (Bombay) Rules,1957.Rule 31 provides: \"The Labour Court,Tribunal or Arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues\tStatute\nThe jurisdiction given to the Tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed\tRatio of the decision\nIt is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected,and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award\tRatio of the decision\nAn accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only\tRatio of the decision\nIt must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved\tRatio of the decision\nIs the instant case one where the amendment made by the Tribunal in the original award can be said to correct a mere clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission\tRatio of the decision\nTo answer the question,it is necessary to examine the basis of the award and the intent which flows from that basis\tRatio of the decision\nThe terms of reference in the State Government's order required the Tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance,and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman\tRatio of the decision\nIt would do well to recall that the claim of the Union filed before the Tribunal also centered on the need to revise the wage scales\tRatio of the decision\nThat was the main issue between the parties\tRatio of the decision\nIt is to the task of revising the pay scales that the Tribunal addressed itself,and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention\tRatio of the decision\nThe financial capacity of the appellant,and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977,were examined from that view point\tRatio of the decision\nThe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail,and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the Tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant,both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future\tRatio of the decision\nThe financial capacity,as the Tribunal observed,constituted one of \"the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure\tRatio of the decision\nA clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award,where the Tribunal stated: \"I only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category\tRatio of the decision\nNo ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended\tRatio of the decision\nAnd that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award: \"Considering this outgoing the flat increase of Rs.150/-in the category of Draughtsman and Rs.100/-in the case of the other categories would be fair\tRatio of the decision\nIt will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured,and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories\tRatio of the decision\nIndividual workmen were not present to the mind of the Tribunal\tRatio of the decision\nThat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales\tRatio of the decision\nThe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier\tRatio of the decision\nThe revised pay scales of all categories,except the category of Draughtsmen,shows an increase of Rs.100/-in the initial pay fixed in each scale,the increase in the case of the category of Draughtsmen being Rs.150/-.There was only one increase contemplated in the award,in paragraph 23 of award,and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories\tRatio of the decision\nNo second flat increase was envisaged at all\tRatio of the decision\nThe amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase,this time to each individual workmen\tRatio of the decision\nIf,as the Tribunal has stated in the amendment order,the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen,there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest\tRatio of the decision\nThere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by Rs.150/-in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs.100/-in the case of other categories\tRatio of the decision\nConsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales,it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale\tRatio of the decision\nConspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen\tRatio of the decision\nEven when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the Tribunal stated in the award: \"In view of the revision of the wage scales,there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance\tRatio of the decision\nAnd the clinching circumstances of all is that the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about Rs.5 lakhs\tRatio of the decision\nIt was that figure which the Tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st\tRatio of the decision\nJanuary,1976.This liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the Tribunal's deliberations in regard to the several features of the award,including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service,the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments,and other benefits\tRatio of the decision\nIt cannot be the case of the Union that the figure of Rs.5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs\tRatio of the decision\nIn its order of 22nd\tFacts\nDecember,1978,the Tribunal has referred to the statement (Exhibit C-51) filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it\tFacts\nThe Tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of Rs.150/-and Rs.100/-was intended to each of the employees in the category of Draughtsmen and the other categories\tFacts\nIn so construing the statement,Exhibit C-51,the Tribunal has grievously erred\tFacts\nIt seems from a perusal of the document,Exhibit C-51,that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases\tRatio of the decision\nOn the basis that a sum of Rs.150/-per month was added to the pay of each Draughtsman and a sum of Rs.100/-was added to the pay of every other workman,who belonged to the Union staff,the financial load would increase to Rs.9,22,032/-.Likewise,if a flat increase of Rs.100/-was given to individual workmen of all categories,including Draughtsmen,the increased financial load would total Rs.7,64,256/-.The statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of Rs.75/-per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be Rs.5,78,220/-.Again,if the flat increase is Rs.65/-per month to the individual workmen of all categories,the additional load would total Rs.4,97,772/-.Finally,on the basis that the individual Draughtsman would be given an increase of Rs.75/-per month and the individual workmen of other categories Rs.50/-per month,the additional load was calculated at Rs.4,63,092/-.It will be noted that the statement,Exhibit C-51,was prepared on the basis of the employees' strength as in December,1971.A similar statement was prepared on the basis of the employees' strength as in September,1978.These statements cannot be regarded as evidence that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the Tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman\tRatio of the decision\nThe statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein\tRatio of the decision\nNone of the alternatives was actually adopted by the Tribunal,because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs.150/-in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs.100/-in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories\tRatio of the decision\nThe addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales; it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman\tRatio of the decision\nIt seems that the Tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the Union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and,consequently,it fell into the error of amending the award\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award\tRatio of the decision\nThe amendment has resulted in the Tribunal making,as it were,a supplementary award,whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award\tRatio of the decision\nThe original award was completed and signed by the Tribunal,and it cannot be reopened now except for the limited purpose of Rule 31.In travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award,the Tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error\tRatio of the decision\nOur attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd December,1978 filed by the Union before the Tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the Tribunal decided,and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application\tRatio of the decision\nIt is an accepted principle that consent by a party cannot confer jurisdiction on a court\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is without jurisdiction will remain so\tRatio of the decision\nIn the circumstances the order of 22nd December,1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award\tRatio of the decision\nThe corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed\tRatio of the decision\nThe second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed\tRatio of the decision\nI shall now consider Civil Appeal No.2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen\tRatio of the decision\nThe only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index\tArgument\nIt is wrong in principle,it is said,to provide a fixed dearness allowance\tRatio of the decision\nReliance was placed on The Hindustan Times Ltd.,New Delhi v\tRatio of the decision\nTheir Workmen [1964] 1 SCR 234 1962 Indlaw SC 436,247 where it was observed by this Court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living\tRatio of the decision\nReference was also made to Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works Limited v\tRatio of the decision\nIts Workmen\tRatio of the decision\n2 SCR 113 1968 Indlaw SC 183.Now,it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index\tRatio of the decision\nThe Tribunal,in the present case,considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein\tFacts\nIt noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10% of the salary subject to a minimum of Rs.50/-and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary\tFacts\nHaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage,it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance\tFacts\nIn view of the increase so secured,the Tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted\tFacts\nIt declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about Rs.1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant\tFacts\nIt was open to the Tribunal to adopt the position which it did\tRatio of the decision\nIf the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered\tRatio of the decision\nThe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales,larger increments,longer span of 20 years for earning increments,dearness allowance at 10% of the basic wage,besides several other benefits,have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the Tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another\tRatio of the decision\nAccordingly,the appeal filed by the workmen must fail\tRatio of the decision\nIn the result,Civil Appeal No.2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd December,1978 of the Industrial Tribunal,Maharashtra Bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th December,1978,and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed\tRuling by Present Court\nCivil Appeal No.2300 of 1979 is dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nThere is no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nCHINNAPPA REDDY,J.We have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother Pathak,J.we agree with him that Civil Appeal No.2300 of 1979 should be dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nWe also agree with him that Civil Appeal No.2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated December 20,1978.However,we do not agree with our learned brother that Civil Appeal No.2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated December 22,1978 of the Industrial Tribunal which purports to correct the award dated December 20,1978.In our opinion Civil Appeal No.2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety\tRuling by Present Court\nWe do not propose to give our reasons to the extent we are in agreement with Pathak,J.and we propose to state our reasons for the disagreement only\tRuling by Present Court\nIt is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of Pathak,J.The Award of the Industrial Tribunal was made on December 20,1978.On December 22,1978 that is to say,two days after the Award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the Tribunal,the respective parties and their Advocates,the employees Union made an application under Rule 31 of the Industrial Disputes (Bombay) Rules,1957 seeking a correction of an error,which it was claimed,had crept into the Award\tRatio of the decision\nThe application was as follows: \"In the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th December,1978\tRatio of the decision\nIn the said award,Your Honour has observed,at the end of Para 22,'In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay,I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance'.Further,it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs.150/-to each draughtsman and Rs.100/-to all other workmen in their basic pay\tRatio of the decision\nThe Union therefore prays the honourable Tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly\tRatio of the decision\nOn this application,the Advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement: \"Submitted to whatever this Hon'ble Tribunal desires to do\tArgument\nThereafter the Tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms: \"There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs.150/-to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and of Rs.100/-to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award\tRuling by Lower Court\nThis order was made in the presence of Shri Manak Gagrat,Advocate for the Company and Shri N.P.Mehta,Advocate for the workmen\tRatio of the decision\nThe endorsement made on the application by the Advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union\tRatio of the decision\nOn the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the Company to the correction sought by the union\tRatio of the decision\nThe order dated December 22,1978 of the Tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award\tRatio of the decision\nEven so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award\tRatio of the decision\nThe primary and basic question considered by the Industrial Tribunal,in making the award dated December 20,1978 was the question of revision of the wage-scales\tRatio of the decision\nImplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage-scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage-scales and flat or ad-hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary\tRatio of the decision\nIt cannot possibly be doubted that an Industrial Tribunal deciding upon the wage-scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad-hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages\tRatio of the decision\nNor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales\tRatio of the decision\nThis in our opinion is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal in revising wage-scales\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case the Industrial Tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden\tFacts\nAt the end of paragraph 15 of the Award,the Tribunal stated: \"But there can be no doubt that the company can very well bear the additional burden\tFacts\nThe question is what should be the extent of such burden\tFacts\nAt the end of paragraph 18 of the award the Tribunal said: A\" mere reading of Exhibit U-15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company\tFacts\nFor some years to come this is likely to be one of the few Consulting Engineers who will be securing major contracts\tFacts\nAgain in Paragraph 19 it was said: \"I have no doubt that the present Company would be able to bear the additional burden for the years to come\tFacts\nThis is further borne out from the trading results of the Company for the year 1968-69 to 1977.The profits have increased all along\tFacts\nThe copy of the letter dated July 23,1973,alongwith\tFacts\nthe Annexures from the Company to the Director General,Posts & Telegraphs,Delhi (Ex.C-27) indicates the important projects the Company was handling in India and abroad,and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated\tFacts\nI will; therefore,proceed on the ground that the present Company can bear the additional financial burden\".Finally at the end of paragraph 21\tFacts\nthe Tribunal said : In view of this position,the Company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage-scales\tFacts\nThe question is to what extent the relief should be given to the employees\tFacts\nAfter expressing himself in categoric terms about the capacity of the company to bear the additional financial burden,the Tribunal went on to say: \"I only propose to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category\".The Tribunal then considered the question whether Draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance should be revised\tFacts\nThe Tribunal then observed: \"......the flat increase of Rs.150/-in the category of Draftsmen and Rs.100/-in the case of the other categories would be fair\".Thereafter various other matters were considered and finally the Tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother Pathak,J.The question of \"Fitment\" was then considered in the following manner: \" Fitment:- If as on 1st January,1976,an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade,he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade\tFacts\nIf the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale,and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales,the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale\tFacts\nAfter fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above,the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below:- (i) Employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st January,1976,3 increments\tFacts\nii) Employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st January,1976,2 increments\tFacts\niii\tFacts\nAll other employees with more than one year's service shall be given one increment\tFacts\nNow,if,without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary,the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay,it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of several senior employees,the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit\tRatio of the decision\nWhile workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage-scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages,they,surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them\tRatio of the decision\nThat was why the Industrial Tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of Rs.150/-in the case of Draftsmen and Rs.100/-in the case of other workmen was called for\tRatio of the decision\nIt was clearly so intended by the Tribunal as is evident from the reference to \"flat increase of Rs.150/-in the category of Draftsmen and Rs.100/-in the case of the other categories\".Since there was to be a flat increase of Rs.150/-and Rs.100/-in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively,the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures Rs.150/-and Rs.100/-above the existing wage scales\tRatio of the decision\nImmediately after the award was pronounced,while the iron was still hot as it were,the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of Rs.150/-and Rs.100/-respectively and might contend that the Tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and restructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,they filed an application before the Tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended\tRatio of the decision\nAs it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend,is precisely what the employer is not contending,though the employer did not choose to so contend before the Industrial Tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification\tRatio of the decision\nThe application before the Tribunal was filed under Rule 31 of the Bombay Industrial Disputes Rules 1957,which is as follows\tStatute\nA Board,Court,Labour Court,Tribunal or Arbitrator may,at any time,suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned,may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings,report,award or as the case may be,decision\tStatute\nThe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure Rs.150/-and again after the figure Rs.100/-was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the Tribunal was entitled to correct\tRatio of the decision\nWe are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise\tRatio of the decision\nWe are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the Company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award\tRatio of the decision\nWe,therefore,see no ground for quashing the order dated December 22,1978 of the Tribunal\tRatio of the decision\nThe result of the foregoing discussion is that Civil Appeal No.2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety\tRatio of the decision\nWe have already indicated that we agree with our brother Pathak,J.,that the appeal (Civil Appeal No.2300 of 1979) filed by the workmen should also be dismissed\tRatio of the decision\nWhile we find lot of force in the submission of Shri V.M.Tarkunde,learned counsel for the workmen that Dearness Allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance,it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under Article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted\tRatio of the decision\nThe Tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the Tribunal\tRatio of the decision\nIn the result both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs\tRatio of the decision\nThe Order of the Court was as follows\tRuling by Present Court\nIn view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\n"

            "text": "We have heard learned counsel on both sides\tFacts\nThe admitted facts are that the respondents through their agents had registered trade mark \"Raleigh\" and other trade marks (12 marks) under the Indian Merchandise Marks Act,1889 (4 of 1989) and the Trade Marks Act,1940 (5 of 1940).The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,1958 (43 of 1958) (for short,the 'Act) which came into force with effect from October 3,1958 has repealed the Predecessor Act and now the Act is in operation\tFacts\nThe respondents entered into an agreement with Sudhir Kumar Sen on November 3,1948 to render technical know-how to the Indian Company to be formed which would manufacture bicycles and market them under Raleigh's Indian Trade marks\tFacts\nPursuant thereto,a company called Sen Raleigh Limited came into existence which manufactured cycles with technical assistance by the respondents-Raleigh Industries of U.K.and marketed the bicycles with a brand name and trade marks belonging to the respondents\tFacts\nOn April 24,1954,Sen\tFacts\nRaleigh was recorded as permitted users of the trade marks\tFacts\nBy agreement dated December 29,1962,Sen Raleigh and the respondents agreed that Sen Raleigh was registered user for further period up to 1976.Sen Raleigh was taken over by the Government of India on September 8,1975 under the IDR Act and the Government took over the management of Sen Raleigh Limited\tFacts\nThe agreement dated December 29,1962 was modified and the respondents were given option to terminate the agreement\tFacts\nAn agreement dated December 20,1976 was entered into between the appellant,as registered user and the respondent in respect of 12 trade marks for a period of 5 years\tFacts\nOn March 28,1978,joint application by Sen Raleigh and the appellant duly signed by the respondent as proprietor and Sen Raleigh Limited as registered user came to be made before the Registrar of Trade Marks\tFacts\nOn October 24,1980,Sen Raleigh was nationalized and got vested in the appellant-Corporation by publication of the notification under IDR Act\tFacts\nOn March 5,1982,the respondent wrote a letter to the appellant that in the absence of a new agreement they were instructing their advocate to prevent the appellant by restraint proceedings to use the trade mark effective from April 1,1982\tFacts\nOn March 24,1982,the appellant made an application under Sections 32,46 and 56 of the Act against the respondents in the High Court of Calcutta in Suit No.266/92 pleading,inter alia,that the respondents had failed to provide technical assistance by passing the technical know-how to Sen Raleigh after November 1,1976.Neither the appellant nor Sen Raleigh were registered users of the trade mark after November 1,1976\tFacts\nu/s.48(2) of the Act up to the date of one month before filing that rectification application\tFacts\nA continuous period of 5 years or longer had passed and the trade mark had not been bona fide used by the respondent\tFacts\nHaving regard to the extended nature of non-user of the concerned trade mark after November 1,1976,any further use of the said trade marks by the respondents was likely to deceive and cause confusion to the trade and public alike in India etc\tFacts\nSimultaneously,an application for registration of three trade marks An their favour was filed by the appellant on March 25,1982\tFacts\nBy proceedings dated June 13,1984,the Registrar of Trade Marks informed the appellant that the registered user's applications were abandoned since the appellant failed to comply with the statutory requirements\tFacts\nThe learned single Judge dismissed the application by his judgment dated September 13,1990 holding,inter alia,that any proprietor mentioned in S.46(1)(b) of the Act extends to bona fide user other than registered users\tFacts\nSpecial circumstances as a defense were available to the respondent for non-user; even after 1979,the supply-technical know-how by the respondent was not totally absent\tFacts\nAfter termination of the collaboration and user agreement between the appellant and the respondents it was likely to cause confusion and deception amongst the trade and public\tFacts\nThe conduct of the respondents was not violative of S.32(b) and (c).The Court in those circumstances declined to rectify the trade mark and strike it off from the register of trade marks\tFacts\nOn appeal,the Division Bench in Appeal No.13/91 confirmed the same holding that on and from October 25,1980,the respondent had allowed and permitted the appellant to manufacture bicycles etc.according its specifications and to pass off the goods under their trade marks\tFacts\nThough the collaboration and registered user agreements stood expired from October 31,1981,no agreement came to be executes nor continued to use the specifications on technical know-how\tFacts\nThere is no specific bar for an unregistered lincesee to use registered trade mark so long as there is a connection in the course of trade between the licenser and the lincesee\tFacts\nThe appellant was unable to prove that there had been no such user of the trade mark for a continuous period of 61 months or longer and the lack of bona fide intention The expression \"by any registered proprietors in S.46(1)(b) should not be restricted to user by proprietor or registered user who should also include bona fide or authorized users The legislature did not intend to register proprietor to be deprived of their property at the instance of user whose use is unregistered\tFacts\nThe expression,therefore,should not be restricted to user by the proprietor himself or any registered user but should also take into account bona fide authorized user\tFacts\nNon registration of the user agreement by Sen Raleigh and the appellant was due to the default of the latter\tFacts\nThe appellant had not taken any steps to withdraw registered user applications and as such should not be permitted to take such a contradictory stand of applying for rectification at the same time\tFacts\nThe power u/s.46 is discretionary\tFacts\nIn view of the appellant's conduct,it was taking advantage of its own wrong\tFacts\nThe discretion,therefore,was not to be extended in favour of the appellant\tFacts\nThus,this appeal by special leave\tFacts\nShri Raju Ramchandran,learned senior counsel for the appellant,raised three-fold contentions\tArgument\nIt is his pivotal contention that undisputedly when the respondent was not in urge of trade mark as \"a registered proprietor\" or its agent Sen Raleigh as Permitted user\" for a period of 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application u/s.46 for removal of the trade mark from the Register,there was no bona fide user thereof in relation to those goods by the proprietor himself\tArgument\nThe respondents admittedly did not use the same\tArgument\nThe appellant cannot be said to be either the proprietor of the trade mark since 1976,since the agreement lapsed or permitted user-.The High Court therefore was wrong in holding that 5 years' period had not lapsed\tArgument\nThe harmonious construction should be put up in such a way that S.48(2) and S.466 by of the Act could be permitted to have their-full play in their operational structure\tArgument\nThe construction put up by the High Court renders sub-s.(2) of S.48 otiose or surplus age which interpretation is impermissible\tArgument\nIt is contended that the registered user must be understood to be the user by the proprietor or authorized user registered under Section 48.The period of 5 years should be computed from that date of expiry of registered user\tArgument\nThe Division Bench,therefore,was wrong in its conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish it\tArgument\nOn the other hand,it is for the respondent to prove the same\tArgument\nHe further contended that the special circumstances enumerated in sub-s.(3) of S.46 must be such that the respondents had intended to use the registered trade mark\tArgument\nFor over a long period,the trade mark was not used by the respondents as its registered proprietor\tArgument\nThe respondents did not prove that they were prevented to use the same for 5 years or more preceding the date of the application\tArgument\nThe burden is on tile respondents to prove that non-user was due to special circumstance of the trade and not due to some other cause which would have operated whether special circumstances had arisen or not Since the respondents were not using the trade mark since April 20,1954,the plea of special circumstances is not available to the respondents\tArgument\nThe Division Bench or the learned single Judge did not record any finding as to the period up to which the bicycles could be imported into India and the period during which the ban was imposed but for which the respondent had an intention to import bicycles but were prevented to do so due to the ban\tArgument\nIn the absence of .such a findings the High Court was wrong in law in refusing to rectify the trade mark and striking it off the register\tArgument\nThe Court while exercising its discretion u/s.46 should look into not only commercial interest of the parties but also public interest\tArgument\nIn normal circumstances,when it is established that the trade mark was not used either by the registered proprietor or the permitted user,the public interest of supply of the quality of the goods marketed by the appellant should be taken into factual consideration for removal of the trade mark from the register\tArgument\nShri Ashok Desai,learned senior counsel for respondents,resisted the contentions\tArgument\nAccording to the learned counsel,the respondents have collaboration agreement with Sen Raleigh which was taken over by the Government under IDR Act and the appellant came to manufacture,with the technical know-how supplied by the respondents,the Raleigh bicycles under the trade mark registered by the respondents in the register of the Registrar under the Act\tArgument\nThe appellant was using the same as an agent\tArgument\nThe operation of S.48(2) must be construed in such a way that the bona fide user even by a non-registered user,so long as there exist a rational connection between the proprietor of the trade mark and passes off the goods in the market manufactured by the appellant,is construed to be a bona fide user for and on behalf of the registered proprietor,namely,the respondents\tArgument\nAdmitted position is that the respondent being the registered proprietor,until it is proved that its trade mark was not used to pass off the goods manufactured by the appellant and that the appellant had discontinued the user and 5 years lapsed thereafter,the non-use of the trade mark continues thereafter,the rectification application u/s.46 (1)(b) would be ordered\tArgument\nIn view of the prohibition to import bicycles,the respondent was prevented to use the trade mark but by collaboration agreement,it was continuing to use the trade mark by the permitted user\tArgument\nThe special circumstance is that the appellant filed an application for registration u/s.48(1) and continued it till it was abandoned\tArgument\nIt would also be considered as a special circumstance for non user\tArgument\nThe discretion exercised by the Court must be judged in the light of the facts and circumstances,The appellant having used the trade mark,it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to contend that he is not a permitted user or a bona fide user of the trade mark\tArgument\nIn view of the diverse contentions,the question arises: whether the High Court was right in refusing to rectify and strike off the trade marks of the respondents from the register of trade marks\tRatio of the decision\nS.46(1)(b) reads as under\tStatute\n46.Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.-(1\tStatute\nSubject to the provisions of section 47,a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either - (a) xxx xxx xxx xxx (b) that up to a date of one month before the date of the application,a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being\tStatute\nSub-s.(3) envisages that \"an application shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of sub-s.(1) or for purpose of sub-s.(2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates\".S.48 provides for registered users which reads thus: '48.Registered users.-(1) Subject to the provisions of section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark; but the Central Government may,by rules made in this behalf,provide that no application for registration as such shall be entertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks.(2) permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be use by the proprietor thereof.and shall be used by a person the proprietor.for the purpose of s.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law\tStatute\nIt would,thus,be apparent that subject to section 46,for a registered trade mark up to date within one month before the date of making application for rectification for a continuous period of 5 years or longer if registered trade mark had not been use during that period,there was no bona fide user in relation to those goods by the proprietor thereof for the time being\tStatute\nThe trade mark should be taken off and struck out form the register of trade marks in respect of any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered .Sub-s.(3) enables the registered proprietor to show special circumstances for the non use of the trade mark due to which circumstances in the trade,he could not use the trade mark for the above period and not with any intention to abandon the use of trade mark or not to use the trade mark in relation to good to which the application for rectification relates\tStatute\nSub-s.(2) of S.48 give defence to \"permitted user\" in relation to a registered trade mark\tStatute\nIt means the use of the trade mark by a registered user of the trade mark in relation to good with which he is connected in the course of trade and in respect of which the trade mark remains registered for the time being and for which he is registered as a registered user and which complies with any conditions or restrictions to which the registration of the trade marks is subjected to\tStatute\nS.48 (1) envisages that subject to the provisions of Section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a \"registered user\" thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as defensive trade mark\tStatute\nThe permitted use of trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed no to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purpose of S.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under the Act or any other law\tStatute\nThe Central Government is empowered to prevent trafficking in trade mark\tStatute\nIt would,therefore,be clear that a permitted use of the trade mark should be done under sub-s.(1) of Section 48.It\tRatio of the decision\nShould be either by the registered proprietor of the trade mark or a person other than the registered proprietor registered u/s.48(1) to use the trade mark by operation of sub-section (2).An un-registered person u/s.48(1) or a person who did not register u/s.(1) of S.48 shall not be deemed to be a registered user for the purpose of S.46 or any other law\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court recorded a finding and it is not disputed across the bar,that the appellant had entered into an agreement with Sen Raleigh which was a permitted user and used the trade mark till November 1,1976 and thereafter by registered user agreement dated December 20,1976 used trade mark for a period of 5 years\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not in dispute that till date of filing of the application,the appellant used the trade mark in passing off the bicycles under the trade mark of the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nThe question,therefore,is: whether the appellant must be deemed to be bona fide user of the trade mark,though there was no agreement nor was it registered as permitted user u/s.48(1\tRatio of the decision\non admitted position and in the facts and circumstances,we are of the view that the appellant was a ago user of the trade mark of the respondent in passing off the bicycles under the trade mark of the respondent who,admittedly,is a registered proprietor\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true,as held by this Court,that to get a trade mark registered without any intention to use it in relation to any goods but merely to make money out of it by selling it to others,the right to use it as a commodity would be trafficking in that trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nIt requires to be prevented and prohibited\tRatio of the decision\nThe Court would not lend assistance to such registered proprietors of the trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nThere must be real trade connection between the proprietor of the trade and licensee of the goods and the intention to use the trade mark must exist at the date of the application for registration of trade mark and such intention must be genuine and bona fide and continue to subsist in order to disprove the charge of trafficking in trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nIt is a question of fact in every case\tRatio of the decision\nThe question is: whether the trade connection exists to dispel the charge of trafficking in the trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nThis question was considered by this Court in American Home Products Corporation vs\tPrecedent\nMac Laboratories Pvt.Ltd and Anr.1985 Indlaw SC 464 and they need no reiteration\tPrecedent\nIt is seen that preceding the nationalization of the Cycle manufacturing industry under the IDR Act,the respondent had a collaboration agreement with Sen Raliegh who was a registered user under Section 48.From him,the appellant came to succeed by statutory operation\tRatio of the decision\nIt was,therefore,not a case of getting the trade mark registered under the Predecessor Act and continuing under the Act for trafficking of the trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that u/s.43(1) either the registered proprietor or a permitted person is required to register as permitted user\tRatio of the decision\nThe benefit of S.46 would be available during the period for which the agreement registered and user continued in furtherance thereof\tRatio of the decision\nIt appears that even an unregistered licensee,so long as there is unbroken Connection in the course of the trade between the licensor and the passing off lincesee's goods under the trade mark,there would be sufficient connection in the course of the trade between the proprietor and bona fide user of the trade mark by unregistered user\tRatio of the decision\nIt must,therefore,be held that though the deemed presumption under sub-s.(2) of S.48 is referable to the permitted user or the registered user and it does not extend to unregistered permitted user,the Connecting link of passing off the goods between the licensor's trade mark and the lincesee should bona fide be with the permission or Consent which may be express or implied by long course of dealings\tRatio of the decision\nIt would connect the registered proprietor and the user of the trade mark by the unregistered lincesee\tRatio of the decision\nThe appellant must be presumed by course of conduct that he is a bona fide user for the purpose of S.46(1)(b\tRatio of the decision\nIn K.R Beri and Co.vs\tPrecedent\nThe Metal Godds Mfg\tPrecedent\nCo Pvt Limited and Anr\tPrecedent\nAIR 1980 Delhi 299 1980 Indlaw DEL 180],the Division Bench construed S.48(2) and held that an unregistered user of the trade mark even With the consent of the proprietor cannot be construed to be a registered user u/s.48(1) and such construction renders sub-s.(2) of S.48 surplus age or otios,which is impermissible by statutory construction\tPrecedent\nWe have given anxious consideration to the reasoning therein\tPrecedent\nOn strict interpretation,the view of the Division Bench may be correct but it is not correct to hold that by a bona fide user of an unregistered user when connection between the proprietor of the trade mark and the permitted user in relation to passing off the goods under the trade mark are proved,it does not render sub-section (2) of S.48 surplus age or otios\tPrecedent\nIt is true that the burden flies on the registered proprietor of the trade mark to establish the exceptions provided under S.46(3).Equally,the applicant for rectification also prima facie shows non-user for the relevant period\tPrecedent\nThen the burden shifts to the proprietor of the trade mark to affirmatively prove the special Circumstances for non-user of trade mark\tPrecedent\nIt must be shown that the non-use of the trade mark is due to special circumstances of the trade and not due to some other Cause which would have operated,whether the special Circumstances had arisen off not\tPrecedent\nAlthough the special circumstances of trade taken by themselves would have prevented the use of the trade mark\tPrecedent\nIf the non-user was,in fact,due to some other circumstances and would have occured whether the circumstances had followed or not,subs.(3) would not apply\tPrecedent\nIt must,therefore,be duty of the registered proprietor to show What non-user was strictly due to the special circumstances of trade and not of any intention on the part of the registered proprietor not to use the trade mark during the relevant period\tPrecedent\nThough there was a ban on impart of the Raleigh cycles manufactured outside India and passed off under the registered mark of the respondents as a registered proprietor,the circumstances do not attracted sub-section (3) of S.46 to relieve the respondents to establish non-user,but on the facts of this case,we have the admitted position that Sen Raleigh,admittedly,was a registered user through which the appellant had bona fide used the registered trade mark of the registered proprietor There is no discontinuance or non-use of the trade mark by the respondent to establish the special circumstances in this case\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not necessary to go into the question whether the application filed by the appellant u/s.48(1) and its pendency would be a special circumstance in favour of the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nSuffice it to hold that subs.(3) of S.46\tRatio of the decision\nis not attracted to the facts in this case\tRatio of the decision\nThe question then is: whether the discretion has been properly exercised by both the Division Bench as well the single Judge in refusing to take off the trade mark from the register by striking off trade mark from the register of the Registrar of Trade Marks\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that while exercising discretion,the Court u/s.46 of the Act should take into consideration not only commercial interest of the parties but also public interest: In para 21.82 at page 386 of the law of Trade Marks and passing-off by P.Narayanan (4th Ed.),it is stated that the Court or the Registrar has discretion in granting or refusing an application for rectification\tRatio of the decision\nOrdinarily,however,the mark will be expunged (taken off) when the factual circumstances necessary for the removal are established unless it is shown that the case comes within the exceptions provided in the sub-section (3).The High Court refused to exercise the discretion to strike off the trade mark from the register\tRatio of the decision\nIt is seen that the appellant had not abandoned,at any point of time,the use of the trade mark of the respondent-registered proprietor till filing of the application\tRatio of the decision\nThough the appellant has not used the trade mark by itself since 1954 and after the expiry of the permitted use by Sen Raleigh until the notice was issued by the respondent directing the appellant not to use the trade mark,the appellant came to use the same in passing off bicycles manufactured by it under trade mark of the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not relevant for the purpose of S.46(1)(b) whether the bicycles were manufactured with the assistance of technical know-how passed on by Sen Raleigh or the permitted user\tRatio of the decision\nSuffice it to state that the appellant,as a fact,had used the trade mark of the respondent in passing off the bicycles manufactured by it\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court,in our view,declined,for good reasons,to rectify the trade mark under Section Act b) of the Act\tRatio of the decision\nWe are also not persuaded to take a different view from that of the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn these circumstances,we are of the view that the High Court has properly exercised its discretion and refused to rectify and strike off the trade mark,from the register of trade marks of the Registrar\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed but,in the circumstances,without costs\tRuling by Present Court\n"

ground that it was not maintainable\tFacts\nThe appeal was filed u/s.2(1) of the M.P.Uchacha Nyayalay (Khand Nyaypeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam,2005\tFacts\nhereinafter referred to as the 'Act').It was held that the order was passed in exercise of power of superintendence u/art.227 of the Constitution of India,1950 (in short the 'Constitution') against which the Letters Patent Appeal is not maintainable\tFacts\nThe order of learned Single Judge was passed on 9.11.2005.Against the said order,special leave petition was filed which was disposed of by this Court by order dated 16.2.2006.We shall refer to the text of the order later\tFacts\nThe High Court construed as if this Court has only waived the limitation for filing of Letters Patent Appeal and there was no direction to consider the case on merits\tFacts\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the order of this Court is very clear and the conclusions of the High Court that merely limitation was waived is contrary to the clear terms of the earlier order of this Court\tArgument\nAdditionally it is submitted that the prayer in the Writ Petition was to quash the order passed by the Assistant Commissioner,Commercial Tax\tArgument\nThat being so,the mere fact that the writ petition was styled u/art.227 of the Constitution is of no consequence\tRatio of the decision\nIt is the nature of the relief sought for and the controversy involved which determines the Article which is applicable\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand supported the impugned judgment of the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe earlier order passed by this Court dated 22.8.2006 reads as follows: \"Heard\tFacts\nSince the impugned order is passed by a learned Single Judge\tFacts\nThe normal remedy is to file a Letters Patent Appeal\tFacts\nSince we had entertained the Special Leave Petition against the learned Single Judge's order it would be appropriate to grant three weeks' time to the petitioner to prefer the LPA which if otherwise free from defect shall be entertained for being considered on merits\tFacts\nThe interim order passed by this Court shall continue for the aforesaid purpose\tFacts\nThe Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly\tFacts\nUnderlined for emphasis\tFacts\nA bare reading of the order shows that the direction was to consider the LPA on merits and time was granted to prefer the LPA within three weeks\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court was directed to dispose of the LPA on merits if it was otherwise free from defect\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court was,therefore,not justified in holding that this Court's earlier order only waived the limitation for filing a Letters Patent Appeal\tRatio of the decision\nOn that score alone the High Court's order is unsustainable\tRatio of the decision\nIn addition,the High Court seems to have gone by the nomenclature gone by the nomenclature i.e.the discription given in the writ petition to be one u/art.227 of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court did not consider the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved in the Writ petition\tRatio of the decision\nAs noted above the prayer was to quash the order of assessment passed by the Assistant Commissioner,Commercial Tax levying purchase as well as Entry Tax\tRatio of the decision\nS.2 of the Act reads as follows: \"2(1\tStatute\nAn appeal shall lie from a judgment or order passed by the one Judge of the High Court in exercise of original jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution of India,to a Division bench comprising of two judges of the same High Court\tStatute\nProvided that no such appeal shall lie against an interlocutory order or against an order passed in exercise of

High Court while issuing writ of certiorari u/art.226 of the Constitution can only annul a decision of a Tribunal whereas u/art.227 of the Constitution it can issue further directions as well\tPrecedent\nAs noted above the prayer in the Writ Petition was to set aside the decision of the assessing officer\tFacts\nIn Umaji Keshao Meshram v\tPrecedent\nRadhikabai [AIR 1986 SC 1272 1986 Indlaw SC 651\tPrecedent\nit was noted as follows\tPrecedent\nU/art.226 an order,direction or writ is to issue to a person,authority or the State\tPrecedent\nIn a proceeding under that article the person,authority or State against whom the direction,order or writ is sought is a necessary party\tPrecedent\nUnder Article 227,however,what comes up before the High Court is the order or judgment of a subordinate court or tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment or order that subordinate court or tribunal has acted within its authority and according to law\tPrecedent\nPrior to the commencement of the Constitution,the Chartered High Courts as also the Judicial Committee had held that the power to issue prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts was an exercise of original jurisdiction (see Mahomedalli Allabux v\tPrecedent\nIsmailji Abdulali (AIR 1926\tPrecedent\nBom 332 1926 Indlaw MUM 144),Raghunath Keshav Khadilkar v\tPrecedent\nPoona Municipality,(AIR\tPrecedent\n1945 Bom 7 1943 Indlaw MUM 140) Ryots of Garabandho v\tPrecedent\nZemindar of Parlakimedi (AIR 1943 PC 164 1943 Indlaw PC 23) and Moulvi Hamid Hasan Nomani\tPrecedent\nv\tPrecedent\nBanwarilal Roy 1947 Indlaw PC 15 [(1946-47) 74 Ind App 120,130-131].In the last mentioned case which dealt with the nature of a writ of quo warranto\tPrecedent\nthe Judicial Committee held: \"In Their Lordships' opinion any original civil jurisdiction possessed by the High Court and not in express terms conferred by the Letters Patent or later enactments falls within the description of ordinary original civil jurisdiction\tPrecedent\nBy Art.226 the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts prior to the commencement of the Constitution has been made wider and more extensive and conferred upon every High Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe nature of the exercise of the power under Article 226,however,remains the same as in the case of the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts\tRatio of the decision\nA series of decisions of this Court has firmly established that a proceeding u/art.226 is an original proceeding and when it concerns civil rights,it is an original civil proceeding (see,for instance,State of U.P.v\tPrecedent\nVijay Anand Maharaj\tPrecedent\n1963) 1 SCR 1 1962 Indlaw SC 340,16],CIT v\tPrecedent\nIshwarlal Bhagwandas [AIR 1965 SC 1818 1965 Indlaw SC 158],Ramesh v\tPrecedent\nSeth Gendalal Motilal Patni (1966 (3) SCR 198 1966 Indlaw SC 395),Arbind Kumar Singh v\tPrecedent\nNand Kishore Prasad[1968 (3) SCR 322 1968 Indlaw SC 223] and Ahmedabad Mfg.& Calico Ptg\tPrecedent\nCo\tPrecedent\nLtd.v\tPrecedent\nRam Tahel Ramnand (AIR 1972 SC 1598 1972 Indlaw SC 378\tPrecedent\nIt was noted as follows\tPrecedent\nThe non obstante clause in Rule 18,namely,\"Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 1,4 and 17 of this chapter\",makes it abundantly clear why that rule uses the words \"finally disposed of\".As seen above,under Rules 1 and 17,applications u/arts.226 and 227 are required to be heard and disposed of by a Division Bench\tPrecedent\nRule 4,however,gives power to a Single Judge to issue rule nisi on an application u/art.226\tPrecedent\nbut precludes him from passing any final order on such application\tPrecedent\nIt is because a Single Judge has no power under Rules 1,4 and 17 to hear and dispose of a petition u\tPrecedent\nart.226 or 227 that the non obstante clause has been introduced in Rule 18.The use of the words \"be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge\" in Rule 18 merely clarifies the position that in such cases the power of the Single Judge is not confined merely to issuing a rule nisi\tPrecedent\nThese words were not intended to bar a right of appeal\tPrecedent\nTo say that the words \"finally disposed of\" mean finally disposed of so far as the High Court is concerned is illogical because Rules 1,4 and 7 use the words \"be heard and disposed of by a Divisional Bench\" and were the reasoning of the Full Bench correct,it would mean that so far as the High Court is concerned,when a Single Judge hears a matter and disposes it of,it is finally disposed of and when a Division Bench disposes it of,it is not finally disposed of\tPrecedent\nThe right of appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge is given by the Letters Patent which have been continued in force by Art.225 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nIf under the Rules of the High Court,a matter is heard and disposed of by a Single Judge,an appeal lies against his judgment unless it is barred either under the Letters Patent or some other enactment\tPrecedent\nThe word \"finally\" used in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules does not and cannot possibly have the effect of barring a right of appeal conferred by the Letters Patent\tPrecedent\nAs we have seen above,an intra-court appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition u/art.226 is not barred while cl.15 itself bars an intra-court appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition u/art.227\tPrecedent\nIn Sushilabai Laxminarayan Mudliyar v\tPrecedent\nNihalchand Waghajibhai Shaha [1993 Supp.(1) SCC 11 1991 Indlaw SC 718\tPrecedent\nthis court with reference to an unreported judgment in Ratnagiri District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd.v\tPrecedent\nDinkar Kashinath Watve 1989 Indlaw SC 421,C.A.No.520 of 1989 decided on 27.1.1989 held as follows: \"Even when in the cause title of an application both Art.226 and Art.227 of the Constitution have been mentioned,the learned single Judge is at liberty to decide,according to facts of each particular case,whether the said application ought to be dealt with only u/art.226 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nFor determining the question of maintainability of an appeal against such a judgment of the Single Judge the Division bench has to find out whether in substance the judgment has been passed by the learned Single Judge in exercise of the jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nIn the event in passing his judgment on an application which had mentioned in its cause title both Arts.226 and 227,the Single Judge has in fact invoked only his supervisory powers under Article 227,the appeal under cl.15 would not lie\tPrecedent\nThe cl.15 of the Letters Patent expressly bars appeals against orders of Single Judges passed under revisional or supervisory powers\tPrecedent\nEven when the learned Single Judge's order has been passed under both the articles,for deciding the maintainability against such an order what would be relevant is the principal or main relief granted by the judgment passed by learned Single Judge and not the ancillary directions given by him\tPrecedent\nThe expression 'ancillary' means,in the context,incidental or consequential to the main part of the order\tPrecedent\nThus,the determining factor is the real nature of principal order passed by the Single Judge which is appealed against and neither the mentioning in the cause title of the application of both the articles nor the granting of ancillary orders thereupon made by learned Single Judge would be relevant\tPrecedent\nThus,in each case,the Division Bench may consider the substance of the judgment under appeal to ascertain whether the Single Judge has mainly or principally exercised in the matter his jurisdiction\tPrecedent\nu/art.226 or u/art.227.In\tPrecedent\nthe event in his judgment the learned Single Judge himself had mentioned the particular article of the Constitution under which he was passing his judgment,in an appeal under cl.15 against such a judgment it may not be necessary for the appellate bench to elaborately examine the question of its maintainability\tPrecedent\nWhen without mentioning the particular article the learned Single Judge decided on merits the application,in order to decide the question of maintainability of an appeal,against such a judgment,the Division Bench might examine the relief granted by the learned Single Judge,for maintainability of an appeal,the determination would be the main and not the ancillary relief\tPrecedent\nWhen a combined application u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution is summarily dismissed without reasons,the appeal Court may consider whether the facts alleged,warranted filing of the application u/art.226 or u/art.227 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nThereafter this Court explained the ratio laid down in the case of Umaji's case1986 Indlaw SC 651 (supra) and expressed thus: \"In Umaji case it was clearly held that where the facts justify a party in filing an application either u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution of India and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles in fairness of justice to party and in order not to deprive him of valuable right of appeal the Court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226,and if in deciding the matter,in the final order the Court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227,this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under cl.15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to be appealed against is u/art.226.Rule 18 of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules read with cl.15 of the Letters Patent provides for appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court from a judgment of the learned Single Judge passed on a writ petition u/art.226 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nIn the present case the Division Bench was clearly wrong in holding that the appeal was not maintainable against the order of the learned Single Judge\tPrecedent\nIn Mangalbhai & Ors.v\tPrecedent\nRadhyshyam (Dr\tPrecedent\nAIR 1993 SC 806 1992 Indlaw SC 509] it was inter alia observed as follows: \"The learned Single Judge in his impugned judgment dated December 11,1987 nowhere mentioned that he was exercising the powers u/art.227 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nThe learned Single Judge examined the matter on merit and set aside the orders of the Rent Controller as well as the Resident Deputy Collector on the ground that the aforesaid judgments were perverse\tPrecedent\nThe findings of the Rent Controller and Resident Deputy Collector were set aside on the question of habitual defaulter as well as on the ground of bona fide need\tPrecedent\nThus in the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case,the pleadings of the parties in the writ petition and the judgment of the learned Single Judge leaves no manner of doubt that it was an order passed u/art.226 of the Constitution and in that view of the matter the Letters Patent Appeal was maintainable before the High Court\tPrecedent\nAfter taking the aforesaid view one course open was to set aside the order of the Division Bench and to remand the matter for being disposed of on merits by the Division Bench of the High Court\tPrecedent\nHowever,taking in view the fact that this litigation is going on for nearly a decade and also the fact that even the learned Single Judge in his impugned order dated December 11,1987 had remanded the case to the Rent Controller,we considered it proper in the interest of justice to hear the appeal on merits against the judgment of the learned Single Judge\tPrecedent\nWe have heard learned counsel for the parties at length on the merits of the case\tPrecedent\nIn Lokmat Newspapers (P\tPrecedent\nShankarprasad [1999 (6) SCC 275 1999 Indlaw SC 587\tPrecedent\nit was observed as follows: \"It is,therefore,obvious that the writ petition invoking jurisdiction of the High Court both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution had tried to make out a case for the High Court's interference seeking issuance of an appropriate writ of certiorari u/art.226 of the Constitution of India\tPrecedent\nBasic averments for invoking such a jurisdiction were already pleaded in the writ petition for the High Court's consideration\tPrecedent\nIt is true,as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant,that the order of the learned Single Judge nowhere stated that the Court was considering the writ petition u/art.226 of the Constitution of India\tPrecedent\nIt is equally true that the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition by observing that the courts below had appreciated the contentions and rejected the complaint\tPrecedent\nBut the said observation of the learned Single Judge did not necessarily mean that the learned Judge was not inclined to interfere u/art.227 of the Constitution of India only\tPrecedent\nThe said observation equally supports the conclusion that the learned Judge was not inclined to interfere u/arts.226 and 227.As seen earlier,he was considering the aforesaid writ petition moved u/art.226 as well as Art.227 of the Constitution of India\tPrecedent\nUnder these circumstances,it is not possible to agree with the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that the learned Single Judge had refused to interfere only u/art.227 of the Constitution of India when he dismissed the writ petition of the respondent\tPrecedent\nIn this connection,it is profitable to have a look at the decision of this Court in the case of Umaji Keshao Meshram v\tPrecedent\nRadhikabai [1986 Supp.SCC 401 1986 Indlaw SC 651].In\tPrecedent\nthat case O.Chinnappa Reddy and D.P.Madon\tPrecedent\nJJ.,considered the very same question in the light of cl.15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court\tPrecedent\nMadon,J.,speaking for the Court  made the following pertinent observations: \"Petitions are at times filed both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nThe case of Hari Vishnu Kamath v\tPrecedent\nSyed Ahmad Ishaque (AIR 1955 SC 233 1954 Indlaw SC 212) before this Court was of such a type\tPrecedent\nRule 18 provides that where such petitions are filed against orders of the tribunals or authorities specified in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules or against decrees or orders of courts specified in that rule,they shall be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge\tPrecedent\nThe question is whether an appeal would lie from the decision of the Single Judge in such a case\tPrecedent\nIn our opinion,where the facts justify a party in filing an application either u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution,and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles,in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal the court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226,and if in deciding the matter,in the final order the court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227,this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under cl.15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to ^*296be appealed against is u\tPrecedent\nart.226.Such was the view taken by the Allahabad High Court in Aidal Singh v\tPrecedent\nKaran Singh (AIR 1957 All 414 1956 Indlaw ALL 107) and by the Punjab High Court in Raj Kishan Jain v\tPrecedent\nTulsi Dass (AIR 1959 Punj 291 1958 Indlaw PNH 109) and Barham Dutt v\tPrecedent\nPeoples' Coop\tPrecedent\nTransport Society Ltd.(AIR 1961 Punj 24 1960 Indlaw PNH 196) and we are in agreement with it\tPrecedent\nThe aforesaid decision squarely gets attracted on the facts of the present case\tRatio of the decision\nIt was open to the respondent to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution of India\tRatio of the decision\nOnce such a jurisdiction was invoked and when his writ petition was dismissed on merits,it cannot be said that the learned Single Judge had exercised his jurisdiction only u/art.226  of the Constitution of India\tRatio of the decision\nThis conclusion directly flows from the relevant averments made in the writ petition and the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the respondent as noted by the learned Single Judge in his judgment,as seen earlier\tRatio of the decision\nConsequently,it could not be said that cl.15 of the Letters Patent was not attracted for preferring appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also necessary to note that the appellant being the respondent in letters patent appeal joined issues on merits and did not take up the contention that the letters patent appeal was not maintainable\tRatio of the decision\nFor all these reasons,therefore,the primary objection to the maintainability of the letters patent appeal as canvassed by learned counsel for the appellant,has to be repelled\tRatio of the decision\nPoint 1 is,therefore,answered in the affirmative against the appellant and in favour of the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nIt takes us to the consideration of points arising for our decision on merits\tRatio of the decision\nIn Surya Dev Rai v\tPrecedent\nRam Chander Rai & Ors.[AIR 2003 SC 3044 2003 Indlaw SC 598] after referring to decisions in Custodian of Evacuee Property,Bangalore v\tPrecedent\nKhan Saheb Abdul Shukoor,etc.[1961 (3) SCR 855 1961 Indlaw SC 499] and Nagendra Nath Bora\tPrecedent\nAnr.v\tPrecedent\nCommissioner of Hills Division\tPrecedent\nAIR 1958 SC 398 1958 Indlaw SC 62],T.C.Basappa v\tPrecedent\nT.Nagappa [AIR 1954 SC 440 1954 Indlaw SC 39] and Rupa Ashok Hurra v\tPrecedent\nAshok Hurra [AIR 2002 SC 1771 2002 Indlaw SC 1966],this Court held as follows: \"From the aforesaid enunciation of law it is quite vivid and luminescent that the pleadings in the writ petition,nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge,character and the contour of the order,directions issued,nomenclature given the jurisdictional prospective in the Constitutional context are to be perceived\tPrecedent\nIt cannot be said in a hypertechnical manner that an order passed in a writ petition,if there is assail to the order emerging from the inferior tribunal or subordinate Court has to be treated all the time for all purposes to be u/art.227 of the Constitution of India\tPrecedent\nPhraseology used in exercise of original jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution in S.2 of the Act cannot be given a restricted and constricted meaning because an order passed in a writ petition can tantamount to an order u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution of India and it would depend upon the real nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge\tPrecedent\nTo elaborate; whether the learned Single Judge has exercised his jurisdiction u/art.226 or u/art.227 or both would depend upon various aspects and many a facet as has been emphasized in the afore quoted decisions of the apex Court\tPrecedent\nThe pleadings,as has been indicated hereinabove,also assume immense significance\tPrecedent\nAs has been held in the case of Surya Devi Rai (supra) a writ of certiorari can be issued u/art.226 of the Constitution against an order of a Tribunal or an order passed by the sub ordinate court\tPrecedent\nIn quintessentiality,it cannot be put in a state jacket formula that any order of the learned judge that deals with an order arising from an inferior tribunal or the sub ordinate court is an order u/art.227 of the Constitution of India and not an order u/art.226 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nIt would not be an over emphasis to state that an order in a writ petition can fit into the subtle contour of Arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution in a composite manner and they can coincide,co-exit,overlap imbricate\tPrecedent\nIn this context it is apt to note that there may be cases where the learned single judge may feel disposed or inclined to issue a writ to do full and complete justice because it is to be borne in mind that Art.226 of the Constitutions is fundamentally a repository and reservoir of justice based on equity and good conscience\tPrecedent\nIt will depend upon factual matrix of the case\tPrecedent\nThus,there is no manner of doubt that the orders and proceedings of a judicial court subordinate to the High Court are amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court u/art.226 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nUpon a review of decided cases and a survey of the occasions,wherein the High Courts have exercised jurisdiction to command a writ of certiorari or to exercise supervisory jurisdiction u/art.227 in the given facts and circumstances in a variety of cases,it seems that the distinction between the two jurisdictions stands almost obliterated in practice\tPrecedent\nProbably,this is the reason why it has become customary with the lawyers labelling their petitions as one common u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution,though such practice has been deprecated in some judicial pronouncement\tPrecedent\nWithout entering into niceties and technicality of the subject,we venture to state the broad general difference between the two jurisdictions\tPrecedent\nFirstly,the writ of certiorari is an exercise of its original jurisdiction by the High Court; exercise of supervisory jurisdiction is not an original jurisdiction and in this sense it is akin to appellate,revisional or corrective jurisdiction\tPrecedent\nSecondly,in a writ of certiorari,the record of the proceedings having been certified and sent up by the inferior court or tribunal to the High Court,the High Court if inclined to exercise its jurisdiction,may simply annul or quash the proceedings and then do no more\tPrecedent\nIn exercise of supervisory jurisdiction,the High Court may not only quash or set aside the impugned proceedings,judgment or order but it may also make such directions as the facts and circumstances of the case may warrant,maybe,by way of guiding the inferior court or tribunal as to the manner in which it would now proceed further or afresh as commended to or guided by the High Court\tPrecedent\nIn appropriate cases the High Court,while exercising supervisory jurisdiction,may substitute such a decision of its own in place of the impugned decision,as the inferior court or tribunal should have made\tPrecedent\nLastly,the jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution is capable of being exercised on a prayer made by or on behalf of the party aggrieved; the supervisory jurisdiction is capable of being exercised suo motu as well\tPrecedent\nIn view of what has been stated above,the High Court was not justified in holding that the Letters Patent Appeal was not maintainable\tRatio of the decision\nIn addition,a bare reading of this Court's earlier order shows that the impugned order is clearly erroneous\tRatio of the decision\nThe impugned order is set aside\tRuling by Present Court\nThe writ appeal shall be heard by the Division Bench on merits\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeal is allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

niece Mukhtiar Kaur and was awarded the death penalty\tFacts\nIn addition, he was convicted for an offence punishable u/s\tFacts\n376 of the IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of Rs.5, 000/- and in default of payment to undergo further R.I. for one year and u/s\tFacts\n309 of the IPC to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year\tFacts\nThe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the High Court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave\tFacts\nThe facts of the case are as under\tFacts\nAt about 2.00 p.m. on 10th November 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming, informed Satnam Singh PW2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of Ujjagar Singh situated in the fields on the outskirts of the village\tFacts\nSatnam Singh conveyed this information to Sarpanch Jora Singh PW1 who was attending a marriage at that time\tFacts\nJora Singh accompanied by Gurdeep Singh PW3 thereupon rushed to Ujjagar Singh's house and found Mukhtiar Kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room\tFacts\nJora Singh and Gurdeep Singh immediately removed Ujjagar Singh to the Civil Hospital, Dhuri in the jeep belonging to Kulwant Singh PW4\tFacts\nJora Singh also met Inspector Harjinder Pal Singh PW14 at 4.40 p.m. near the hospital, who recorded his statement at that place and with his endorsement Ex\tFacts\nP.A. sent it to Police Station, Dhuri where the formal FIR was registered at about 4.45 p.m. with the special report being delivered to the Illaka Magistrate at Dhuri itself at 6.20 p.m. the same evening\tFacts\nThe facts as narrated were that Arjan Singh of village Bangawali had three sons Puran Singh, Ujjagar Singh (appellant) and Ajmer Singh\tFacts\nPuran Singh had died about 20 years earlier leaving behind his wife, two sons and a daughter Mukhtiar Kaur\tFacts\nThe two sons and the wife also died long before the incident and Mukhtiar Kaur the sole surviving member of this branch of the family had been married to Balwinder Singh PW9 about 9 or 10 years earlier\tFacts\nPuran Singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant's sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by Mukhtiar Kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her\tFacts\nIt appears that Mukhtiar Kaur's relations with her in-laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with Ujjagar Singh, her uncle, 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that Mukhtiar Kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide\tFacts\nHaving recorded the aforesaid facts in the FIR, PW14 Inspector Harjinder Pal Singh reached the place of incident and lifted one spent 12 bore cartridge case (Shaktiman make) from near Mukhtiar Kaur's dead body and one DBBL gun from the place where Ujjagar Singh appeared to have been shot and another spent cartridge case was recovered from the right barrel of the gun\tFacts\nAfter completion of the investigation at the spot, Mukhtiar Kaur's dead body was sent for its post-mortem examination\tFacts\nThe post-mortem examination was also conducted by PW5 Dr. Ishwar Singh, Medical Officer, Civil Hospital along with Dr. Harwinder Kaur PW17 and it was found that Mukhtiar Kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body, a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining  and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3.5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest\tFacts\nDr. Harwinder Kaur aforesaid also took swabs from the vagina of the deceased and as per the chemical examiner's report dated 2.1.2003 semen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that Mukhtiar Kaur had been wearing at the time of her death\tFacts\nThe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory which in its report dated 4.8.2004 opined that the crime cartridge case CI 'could' have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case C2 'had been' fired from the right barrel\tFacts\nOn the completion of the investigation, a charge-sheet under sections 302, 376 and 309 of the IPC was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial\tFacts\nDuring the trial Jora Singh PW1, Satnam Singh PW2, Gurdeep Singh PW3 and Kulwant Singh PW4 resiled from their statements given to the police and were declared hostile\tFacts\nBalwinder Singh PW9, however, supported the prosecution case deposing that the land had in fact been got transferred from Gurmail Kaur, mother of Mukhtiar Kaur to Ujjagar Singh by fraud and Mukhtiar Kaur was therefore entitled to its return\tFacts\nHe also deposed that Mukhtiar Kaur had told him some time earlier that the accused had been beating her and had also committed sexual intercourse with her and that at about 11 p.m. on 10.11.2002 Karam Singh PW10 had informed him as to what had transpired on which he along with his father Hamir Singh PW12 and several others had rushed to Bangawali\tFacts\nPW10 Karam Singh aforesaid confirmed the story given by Balwinder Singh\tFacts\nThe prosecution also relied on the statements of Dr. Vijay Kumar PW6 of the Civil Hospial, Dhuri who testified that the appellant had been brought to the hospital at about 2.45 p.m. on 10.11.2002 with a serious gun shot injury, Dr. Ripan Miglani PW15 of the Dayanand Medical College & Hospital, Ludhiana who deposed that he had been admitted to the department of Neuro surgery with a serious gun shot injury and Dr. Sanjay Uppal PW16, a plastic surgeon who disclosed that the appellant had been under his treatment for almost 5 weeks and the burnt area around the firearm injury had been removed by him\tFacts\nThe prosecution also placed reliance on the statement of ASI Jasbir Singh PW11 who had accompanied Inspector Harjinder Pal Singh PW14 to the place of incident and supported the recoveries made from the spot\tFacts\nThe prosecution case was then put to the accused and his statement recorded u/s\tFacts\n313 of the Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C\tFacts\nIn reply to question 33 he stated as under: \"I am innocent\tFacts\nI have been implicated falsely in this case\tFacts\nI was treating Mukhtiar Kaur as my daughter and loved her as my daughter\tFacts\nFalse allegations have been levelled against me\tFacts\nI never harassed Mukhtiar Kaur nor ever got her land mutated from her mother by fraud\tFacts\nI have not killed Mukhtiar Kaur\tFacts\nMother of Mukhtiar Kaur got the land mutated by her own free will and Mukhtiar Kaur had no dispute about it\tFacts\nBalwinder Singh her husband was addicted to vices and used to beat her due to which she used to remain under depression and sick generally, and used to come to me as my daughter\tFacts\nMy house (kothi) is situated on the outer skirts of village Bangawali and door (planks) had not been fixed so far to rooms\tFacts\nSome body suddenly came and fired at me\tFacts\nI fell down on the ground and became unconscious\tFacts\nTherefore, I could not see what had happened to Mukhtiar Kaur as she was in other room\tFacts\nLater on I came to know that some body had fired at her and she died\tFacts\nI regained consciousness in hospital\tFacts\nThe story of rape by me with her has been fabricated by her husband as he is inimical towards me\tFacts\nEven I do not know who took me to hospital\tFacts\nI have been implicated in this case falsely\tFacts\nThe trial court and the High Court relying on the circumstances available on the evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant, as already mentioned above\tRuling by Lower Court\nMr. Goburdhan, the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing\tArgument\nHe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that Mukhtiar Kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out\tArgument\nHe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i.e. Jora Singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone, it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay\tArgument\nIt has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening, charring or burning around the wound on Ujjagar Singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt\tArgument\nIt has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of Ujjagar Singh's sons in the year 1994 by Gurmail Kaur, mother of Mukhtiar Kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that Mukhtiar Kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such, the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist\tArgument\nThe learned State counsel has, however, supported the judgment of the courts below\tArgument\nHe has further emphasized that the prosecution's case stood proved from various factors including the medical evidence, the reports of the Forensic Science Laboratory, the Chemical Examiner, from the post-mortem reports and the recovery of the gun and cartridges\tArgument\nWe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record\tRatio of the decision\nWe first take up for consideration the question of the conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n376 of the IPC\tRatio of the decision\nWe find from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner's reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen\tRatio of the decision\nThere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest (even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant) that he had done so without Mukhtiar Kaur's consent or against her will\tRatio of the decision\nSome suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised had some tell tale injuries been detected on Mukhtiar Kaur's person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot wounds i.e. injury No.3 being on the left pinna and\tRatio of the decision\nNo. 4 an abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape or the commission of rape\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned State counsel relying on the statement of PW14 Inspector Harjinder Pal Singh has however submitted that the examination had not been possible as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury and was hanging between life and death\tRatio of the decision\nWe agree with the submission of the learned counsel that an examination could not have been carried out immediately\tRatio of the decision\nbut we see no justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him examined after he had recovered his health and been discharged from hospital\tRatio of the decision\nWe are further of the opinion that even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between the two had indeed taken place it cannot be said from the evidence before us that it was without the consent or against the wishes of Mukhtiar Kaur\tRatio of the decision\nWe, therefore, find that Ujjagar Singh's conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n376 of the IPC cannot be sustained\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Goburdhan has placed great emphasis on the fact that as the four witnesses who had reached the place of incident i.e. Jora Singh, Satnam Singh, Gurdeep Singh and Kulwant Singh had resiled from their statements and had disowned their initial stories, the prosecution had of necessity to rely on circumstantial evidence and if the chain of circumstances remained incomplete or even if one link in the chain was broken, the prosecution must fail\tArgument\nHe has also relied on the judgment of Balu Sonba Shinde v. State of Maharashtra (2002) 7 SCC 543 2002 Indlaw SC 1923 to contend that it was open to the accused to take advantage (insofar as possible) from the statement of a witness though declared hostile and the four witnesses having disowned the prosecution story and having given a different version, the appellant was entitled to derive such benefit as possible in this situation\tArgument\nThe learned State counsel has, however, emphasized that both the trial court and the High Court had for good reasons opined that the circumstances made out a case for conviction and the accused having given a counter version some obligation lay on him as well to explain the circumstances against him inasmuch that admittedly he and the victim were alone in the house at the time of the incident\tArgument\nReliance for this argument has been placed on the decision of Raj Kumar Prasad Tamarkar v. State of Bihar & Anr. 2007(1\tArgument\nSCALE 19 2007 Indlaw SC 5\tArgument\nWe have considered their arguments very carefully\tPrecedent\nIn Mahmood v. State of U.P. (1976) 1 SCC 542 1975 Indlaw SC 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied - (a)that the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn, have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt; (b)that the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; and (c)that the circumstances, taken collectively, are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him\tPrecedent\nIn this case this Court held that the omission of the prosecution, inter-alia, to have the finger prints found on the alleged murder weapon was fatal to the prosecution story\tPrecedent\nIn 1984 (4) SCC 116 Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra 1984 Indlaw SC 432, this Court discussed the ratio of the judgments in Hanumant v. State of M.P. AIR 1952 SC 343 1952 Indlaw SC 89, Tufail (Alias) Simmi v. State of U.P\tPrecedent\n1969) 3 SCC 198 1969 Indlaw SC 573 and Ramgopal v. State of Maharashtra (1972) 4 SCC 625 1971 Indlaw SC 555 and Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra (1973) 2 SCC 793 1973 Indlaw SC 181 and observed thus: \"A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established: (1)the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established\tPrecedent\nIt may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned 'must or should' and not 'may be' established\tPrecedent\nThere is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between 'may be proved' and \"must be or should be proved\" as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra 1973 Indlaw SC 181 where the following observations were made\tPrecedent\nCertainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between 'may be' is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions\tPrecedent\n2)the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty, (3)the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, (4)they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and (5)there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused\tPrecedent\nMr. Goburdhan has also cited Mahmood v. State of U.P. (1976) 1 SCC 542 1975 Indlaw SC 643, Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit v. State of Maharashtra (1981) 2 SCC 35 1980 Indlaw SC 47, Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v.

(2006) 10 SCC 172 2006 Indlaw SC 144 in support of his plea relating to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence\tRatio of the decision\nThese judgments have broadly followed the principles laid down in the judgments referred to above and need not therefore be dealt with us in extenso\tRatio of the decision\nIt must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted\tRatio of the decision\nIt is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case\tRatio of the decision\nA few facts stand out from the prosecution story\tRatio of the decision\nFirst, the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed DBBL gun is proved on record\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife, mother and son, and two daughters, who were studying outside the village, were frequent visitors, but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered, one from near Mukhtiar Kaur's dead body, and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Goburdhan has, however, laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly\tArgument\nWe are of the opinion, however, that no adverse inference can be drawn from either of these circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nThe aforesaid articles had been carried to the Laboratory by Constable Gopal Singh who in his affidavit dated 17th March 2003 deposed that he had first taken the articles to the laboratory on 9th December 2002 but they had been returned by the Director on the ground that the seals affixed thereon were not of the requisite number and that after removing the objections raised by the Director, the articles aforesaid had been returned to the laboratory on 18th December 2002\tRatio of the decision\nGopal Singh was cross-examined by the prosecution\tRatio of the decision\nand but for some inconsequential questions put to him with regard to the seals, not even a suggestion was made that the aforesaid articles had in any way been tampered with\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true, as contended, that in Column 22 of the inquest report which refers to the articles found near the dead body, there is no reference to the spent cartridges or the murder weapon but we find from a perusal of the site plan Exh\tRatio of the decision\nPJJ prepared by the investigating officer Inspector Harjinder Pal Singh PW14 on 10th November 2002 that the weapon is shown lying close to the place where the appellant had been found unconscious and a spent cartridge recovered from near the dead body of Mukhtiar Kaur\tRatio of the decision\nIt has also been submitted by Mr. Goburdhan that there appeared to be no motive for the incident as the story about Mukhtiar Kaur's unhappiness about the transfer of land to the sons of Ujjagar Singh sought to be proved by PW9 Balwinder Singh and PW10 Karam Singh had been disbelieved by the High Court with the observation that the statements of these two witnesses could not be relied upon\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and (to use the clichi\tRatio of the decision\nthe motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy\tRatio of the decision\nThere is however a hint in the testimony of PW14 Inspector Harjinder Pal Singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with Mukhtiar Kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident\tRatio of the decision\nThere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion, as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i.e. mother, wife, son living (in the village) and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel, but were frequent visitors home, yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour\tRatio of the decision\nTo our mind, therefore, this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Goburdhan has also laid much stress on the apparent discordance between the prosecution story and the medical evidence and has argued that had the accused attempted to commit suicide, the gun shot must, of necessity, had to be fired from a very close range on which the wound would have marks of burning or charring and that in any event a full blooded shot from a very close range would have torn his face apart\tArgument\nHe has in this connection referred us to the statement of Dr. Ripan Miglani PW15 and the wound found on the appellant at the time of his medical examination in the Department of Surgery of the Dayanand Medical College & Hospital, Ludhiana which was \"About 15 x 8 cm curvilinear wound present on the left half of face extending upto bone\tArgument\nNo blackening or foreign body was visible\tArgument\nUnderlying muscles were exposed and contamination was present\tArgument\nHe has thus urged that the absence of any blackening underlined the argument that the shot had been fired from some distance and as such an attempt at suicide was clearly to be ruled out\tArgument\nHe has also drawn our attention to the cross- examination of the Doctor wherein he reiterated that there was no visible blackening and that it was not possible for him to say whether the injury was suicidal or otherwise\tArgument\nThe learned State counsel has, however, relied on the statement of PW16 Dr. Sanjay Uppal, who was apparently the first doctor to have examined the appellant, wherein he clearly testified that the blackened portion around the firearm injury had been removed by him\tArgument\nWe are therefore of the opinion that this statement falsifies Mr. Goburdhan's argument on this aspect\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible, through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury, albeit a very serious one\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan Exh\tRatio of the decision\nPJJ wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point E whereas the appellant was found lying at point D in the same room\tRatio of the decision\nIt is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by Dr. Sanjay Uppal\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned State counsel has emphasized that in the light of the admitted position that the accused and the deceased were the only ones present at the time of incident and that the accused had projected a counter story, some credible explanation was also expected from him\tArgument\nReference has been made to Raj Kumar Prasad Tamarkar's case2007 Indlaw SC 5 (supra) wherein in circumstances surprisingly akin to the present matter, this Court had the following observations to make: \"The conspectus of the events which had been noticed by the learned Sessions Judge as also by the High Court categorically go to show that at the time when the occurrence took place, the deceased and the respondent only were in the bedroom and the terrace connecting the same\tArgument\nThere was no other person\tArgument\nThe cause of death of the deceased Usha Devi i.e. by a gun shot injury is not disputed\tArgument\nThe fact that the terrace and the bedroom are adjoining each other is not in dispute\tArgument\nThe autopsy report shows that 'a blackening and charring' existed so far as Injury No.(i) is concerned\tArgument\nThe blackening and charring keeping in view the nature of the firearm, which is said to have been used clearly go to show that a shot was fired from a short distance\tArgument\nBlackening or charring is possible when a shot is fired from a distance of about 2 feet to 3 feet\tArgument\nIt, therefore, cannot be a case where the death might have been caused by somebody by firing a shot at the deceased from a distance of more than 6 feet\tArgument\nThe place of injury is also important\tArgument\nThe lacerated wound was found over grabella (middle of forehead\tArgument\nIt goes a long way to show that the same must have been done by a person who wanted to kill the deceased from a short distance\tArgument\nThere was, thus a remote possibility of causation of such type of injury by any other person, who was not in the terrace\tArgument\nOnce the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time, the room and terrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple, the burden of proof lay upon the respondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife\tArgument\nThe onus was on him\tArgument\nHe failed to discharge the same\tArgument\nWe have considered the submission of the State counsel very carefully\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one, some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime\tRatio of the decision\nIn his statement u/s\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. his positive stand was that he alone had been in the house with Mukhtiar Kaur when she had been killed and indeed as per Exhibit P.JJ Mukhtiar Kaur's body had been found only one Karam (5 feet) away from the place where the appellant lay injured\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be emphasized that but for this self serving statement made by the appellant, there is nothing on record to support his positive stance\tRatio of the decision\nEven otherwise, we are of the opinion that had the shot been fired by some intruder, the direction would have been more or less horizontal and parallel to the ground and not from down upwards with the pellets hitting the jaw, skirting the cheek and hitting the roof at point\tRatio of the decision\nE\tRatio of the decision\nIn Modi's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (23rd Edition) at page 765 while dealing with identification of homicidal and suicidal injuries it has been observed that : \"A suicidal firearm wound is usually a contact wound situated on the side of the temple, depending on which hand was used to shoot himself, in the centre of the forehead, the roof of the mouth, in the chest or epigastrium in front or the left side and some times under the chin\tRatio of the decision\nThe firearm is usually fired at close range\tRatio of the decision\nA small weapon like a revolver or a pistol is held in the hand, while a rifle or a shot gun is supported on the ground or against the wall\tRatio of the decision\nSometimes, the firing is done by pulling a string tied to the trigger by the big toe\tRatio of the decision\nThe skin around the entry wound shows characteristic blackening, scorching and tattooing\tRatio of the decision\nIn such cases the hand used to steady the weapon at the muzzle may be blackened and scorched and may also be stained with squirting of the blood from the injured arteries\tRatio of the decision\nIn homicidal and accidental shooting, the wound may be on any part of the body and the path of the bullet may be in any direction\tRatio of the decision\nHomicidal shooting by dacoits is not uncommon in India, and they are known to make their own firearms\tRatio of the decision\nImmediate death following a firearm wound is uncommon and even when vital organs are injured, a person may be capable of doing extraordinary things\tRatio of the decision\nSometimes, firearm wounds may look like knife slashes or a bullet hole may resemble a penetrating stab wound, if the bullet strikes the head of shoulder at an angle or when an unstable bullet registers a broadside hit\tRatio of the decision\nA Fateh describes a rare homicidal gun shot wound of the mouth, where the entry wound was in the tongue and the direction was horizontally backward, while in suicidal wounds the direction is upwards-entrance would be in the palate or posterior pharynx\tRatio of the decision\nDr. B.R.Sharma in his Book 'Forensic Science in Criminal Investigation and Trials' (Fourth Edition), at Page 1160 too has delineated the circumstances that could indicate suicide and while referring to the site of the injury has observed: \"Certain sites are predominantly used by suicides for self-inflicted injuries\tRatio of the decision\nFor example, with firearm, temple,forehead,mouth and chest are the favourite sites\tRatio of the decision\nWith knife throat and wrist are the favourite sites\tRatio of the decision\nHesitation injuries are also observed in some suicide cases\tRatio of the decision\nIt is, therefore, clear to us that the story of unknown assailants entering the house and causing Mukhtiar Kaur's murder etcetera has to be ruled out and that the prosecution story that it was the appellant who had first shot Mukhtiar Kaur and then attempted to commit suicide, stands proved\tRatio of the decision\nWe also find that no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nIt would be seen that both the Sessions Court and the High Court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder\tRatio of the decision\nWe are however of the opinion, as already noted above, that a case of rape has not been made out\tRatio of the decision\nIn this background the death sentence is not called for\tRatio of the decision\nWe accordingly acquit the appellant of the charge u/s\tRuling by Present Court\n376 of the IPC but maintain his conviction for the other offences but commute his death sentence to life\tRuling by Present Court\nWith this modification, the appeal is dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

            "text": "One Lakshminarayana Iyer, a Hindu Brahmin, who owned considerable properties in the Tirunelveli district, died on 13th December, 1924, leaving him surviving a widow Ranganayaki, and a married daughter Ramalakshmi\tFacts\nRamalakshmi had married the plaintiff and had a number of children from him\tFacts\nThey were all alive in December, 1924, when Lakshminarayana died\tFacts\nBefore his death he executed a will on 16th November, 1924, the construction of which is in controversy in this appeal\tRatio of the decision\nBy this will he gave the following directions -- \"After my lifetime, you, the aforesaid Ranganayaki Amminal, my wife, shall till your lifetime, enjoy the aforesaid entire properties, the outstandings due to me, the debts payable by me, and the chit amounts payable by me\tFacts\nAfter your lifetime Ramalakshmi Ammal, our daughter and wife of Rama Ayyar Avergal of Melagaram village, and her heirs shall enjoy them with absolute rights and powers of alienation such as gift, exchange, and sale from son to grandson and so on for generations\tFacts\nAs regards the payment of maintenance to be made to Chinnanmal alias Lakshmi Ammal, wife of my late son Hariharamayyan, my wife Ranganayaki Ammal shall pay the same as she pleases, and obtain a release deed\tFacts\nRanganayaki entered into possession of the properties on the death of her husband\tFacts\nOn 21st February, 1928, she settled the maintenance claim of Lakshmi Ammal and obtained a deed of release from her by paying her a sum of Rs\tFacts\n3,350 in cash and by executing in her favour an agreement stipulating to pay her a sum of Rs\tFacts\n240 per annum\tFacts\nRamalakshmi died on 25th April, 1938 during the lifetime of the widow\tFacts\nNone of her children survived her\tFacts\nOn the 24th July, 1945, the widow describing herself as an absolute owner of the properties of her husband sold one of the items of the property to the 2nd defendant for Rs. 500\tFacts\nOn the 18th September, 1945, the suit out of which this appeal arises was instituted by the plaintiff, the husband and the sole heir of Ramalakshmi, for a declaration that the said sale would not be binding on him beyond the lifetime of the widow\tFacts\nA prayer was made that the widow be restrained from alienating the other properties in her possession\tFacts\nOn the 19th September, 1945, an ad interim injunction was issued by the High Court restraining the widow from alienating the properties in her possession and forming part of her husband's estate, Inspite of this injunction, on the 27th September, 1945, she executed two deeds of settlement in favour of the other defendants comprising a number of properties\tFacts\nThe plaintiff was allowed to amend his plaint and include therein a prayer for a declaration in respect of the invalidity of these alienations as well\tFacts\nIt was averred in the plaint that Ramalakshmi obtained a vested interest in the suit -properties under the will of her father and plaintiff was thus entitled to maintain the suit\tFacts\nThe defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had no title to maintain the suit, that the widow was entitled under the will to an absolute estate or at least to an estate analogous to and not less than a widow's estate, that the estate given to Ramalakshmi under the will was but a contingent one and she having predeceased the widow, no interest in the suit properties devolved on the plaintiff\tFacts\nThe main issue in the suit was whether- the widow took under the will an absolute estate or an estate like the Hindu widow's estate and whether the daughter's interest therein was in the nature of a contingent remainder, or whether she got in the properties a vested interest\tFacts\nThe subordinate judge held that the widow took under the will a limited life, interest, and not an absolute estate or even a widow's estate under Hindu law, and that the daughter got there under a vested interest in the properties to which the plaintiff succeeded on her death\tRuling by Lower Court\nIn view of this finding he granted the plaintiff a declaratory decree to the effect that the first defendant had only an estate for life in the suit properties and that the alienations made by her would not endure beyond her lifetime\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe question as to the validity of the alienations was left undetermined\tFacts\nThe unsuccessful defendants preferred an appeal against this decree to the High Court of Judicature at Madras\tFacts\nDuring the pendency of the appeal the widow died on 14th February, 1948\tFacts\nThe High Court by its judgment under appeal affirmed the decision of the trial judge and maintained his view on the construction of the will\tFacts\nLeave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted and the appeal was admitted on the 27th November, 1951\tFacts\nThe substantial question to decide in the appeal is whether the estate granted by the testator to his widow was a fall woman's estate under Hindu law or merely a limited life estate in the English sense of that expression\tRatio of the decision\nIt was not contested before us that a Hindu can by will create a life estate, or successive life estates, or any other estate for a limited term, provided the donee or the persons taking under it are capable of taking under a deed or will\tRatio of the decision\nThe decision of the appeal thus turns upon the question whether the testator's intention was to give to his widow ail ordinary life, estate or an estate analogous to that of a Hindu widow\tRatio of the decision\nAt one time it was a moot point whether a Hindu widow's estate could be created by will, it being an estate created by law, but it is now settled that a Hindu can confer by means of a will oil his widow the same estate which she would get by inheritance\tRatio of the decision\nThe widow in such a case takes as a demise and not as an heir\tRatio of the decision\nThe court's primary duty in such cases is to ascertain from the language employed by the testator \"what were his intentions\", keeping in view the surrounding circumstances, his ordinary notions as a Hindu in respect to devolution of his property, his family relationships etc\tRatio of the decision\nin other words, to ascertain his wishes by putting itself, so to say, in his armchair\tRatio of the decision\nConsidering the will in the light of these principles,it seems to us that Lakshminarayan Iyer intended by his will to direct that his entire properties should be enjoyed by his widow during her lifetime but her interest in these properties should come to an end on her death, that all these properties in their entirety should thereafter be enjoyed as absolute owners by his daughter and her heirs with powers of alienation, gift, exchange and sale from generation to generation\tRatio of the decision\nHe wished to make his daughter a fresh stock of descent so that her issue, male or female, may have the benefit of his property\tRatio of the decision\nThey were the real persons whom he earmarked with certainty as the ultimate recipients of his bounty\tRatio of the decision\nIn express terms he conferred on his daughter powers of alienation byway of gift, exchange, sale, but in sharp contrast to this, on his widow he conferred no such powers\tRatio of the decision\nThe direction to her was that she should enjoy the entire properties including the outstandings etc\tRatio of the decision\nand these shall thereafter pass to her daughters\tRatio of the decision\nThough no restraint in express terms was put on her powers of alienation in case of necessity, even that limited power was not given to her in express terms\tRatio of the decision\nIf the testator had before his mind's eye his daughter and her heirs as the ultimate beneficiaries of his bounty, that intention could only be achieved by giving to the widow a limited estate, because by conferring a full Hindu widow's estate on her the daughter will, only have a mere spes successions under the Hindu law which may or may not mature and under the will her interest would Only be a contingent one in what was left indisposed of by the widow\tRatio of the decision\nIt is significant that the testator did not say in the will that the daughter will enjoy only the properties left indisposed of by the widow\tRatio of the decision\nThe extent of the grant, so far as the properties mentioned in the schedule are concerned, to the daughter and the widow is the same\tRatio of the decision\nJust as the widow was directed to enjoy tile entire properties mentioned in the schedule during her lifetime in like manner the daughter and her heirs were also directed to enjoy the same properties with absolute rights from generation to generation\tRatio of the decision\nThey could not enjoy the same properties in the manner directed if the widow had a full Hindu widow's estate and had the power for any purpose to dispose of them and did so\tRatio of the decision\nIf that was the intention, the testator would clearly have said that the daughter would only take the properties remaining after the death of the widow\tRatio of the decision\nThe widow cannot be held to have been given a full Hindu widow's estate under the will unless it can be said that under its terms she was given the power of alienation for necessary purposes, whether in express terms or by necessary implication\tRatio of the decision\nAs above pointed out, admittedly power of alienation in express terms was not conferred on her\tRatio of the decision\nIt was argued that such a power was implicit within the acts she was authorized to do, that is to say, when she was directed to pay the debts and settle the maintenance of Ramalakshmi it was implicit within these directions that for these purposes, if necessity arose, she could alienate the properties\tArgument\nThis suggestion in the surrounding circumstances attending the execution of this will cannot be sustained\tRuling by Present Court\nThe properties disposed of by the will and mentioned in the schedule were considerable in extent and it seems that they fetched sufficient income to enable the widow to fulfil the obligations under the will\tRatio of the decision\nIndeed we find that within four years of the death of the testator the widow was able to pay a lump sum of Rs\tRatio of the decision\n3,350 in cash to the daughter-in-law without alienating any part of the immovable properties and presumably by this time she had discharged all the debts\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not shown that she alienated a single item of immovable property till the year 1945, a period of over 21 years after the death of her husband, excepting one, which she alienated in the year 1937 to raise a sum of Rs\tRatio of the decision\n1,000 in order to buy some land\tRatio of the decision\nBy this transaction she substituted one property by another\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of her maintenance, for payment of debts etc., and for settling the claim of the daughter-in-law she does not appear to have felt any necessity to make any alienation of any part of the estate mentioned in the schedule and the testator in all likelihood knew that she could fulfil these obligations without having recourse to alienations and hence he did not give her any power to do so\tRatio of the decision\nIn this situation the inference that the testator must have of necessity intended to confer on the widow power of alienation for those limited purposes cannot be raised\tRatio of the decision\nIn our opinion, even if that suggestion is accepted that for the limited purposes mentioned in the will the widow could alienate, this power would fall far short of the powers that a Hindu widow enjoys under Hindu law\tRatio of the decision\nUnder that law she has the power to alienate the estate for the benefit of the soul of the husband, for pilgrimage and for the benefit of the estate and for other authorized purposes\tRatio of the decision\nIt cannot be said that a Hindu widow can only alienate her husband's estate for payment of debts, to meet maintenance charges and for her own maintenance\tRatio of the decision\nShe represents the estate in all respects and enjoys very wide power except that she cannot alienate except for necessity and her necessities have to be judged on a variety of considerations\tRatio of the decision\nWe therefore hold that the estate conferred on Ranganayaki Ammal was more like the limited estate in the English sense of the term than like a full Hindu widow's estate in spite of the directions above- mentioned\tRuling by Present Court\nShe had complete control over the income of the property during her lifetime\tRatio of the decision\nbut she had no power to deal with the corpus of the estate\tRatio of the decision\nand it had to be kept intact for the enjoyment of the daughter\tRatio of the decision\nThough the daughter was not entitled to immediate possession of the property it was indicated with certainty that she should get the entire estate at the proper time\tRatio of the decision\nand she thus got an interest in it on the testator's death\tRatio of the decision\nShe was given a present right of future enjoyment in the property\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to Jarman (Jarman on Wills), the law leans in favour of vesting of estates and the property disposed of belongs to the object of the gift when the will takes effect and we think the daughter got under this will a vested interest in the testator's properties on his death\tRatio of the decision\nIt was strenuously argued by Mr. K. S. Krishnaswami Iyengar that Lakshminarayana Iyer was a Brahmin gentleman presumably versed in the sastras, living in a village in the southernmost part of the Madras State, that his idea of a restricted estate was more likely to be one analogous to a Hindu woman's estate than a life estate a,-, understood in English law wherein the estate is measured by use and not by duration, and that if this will was construed in the light of the notions of Lakshminarayana Iyer it should be held that the widow got under it a Hindu widow's estate and the daughter got under it a contingent remainder in the nature of spes and on her death there was nothing which could devolve on the plaintiff and he thus had no locus standi to question the alienations made by the widow\tArgument\nThe learned counsel in support of his contention drew our attention to a number of decisions of different High Courts and contended that the words of this will should be construed in the manner as more or less similar words were construed by the courts in the wills dealt with in those decisions\tArgument\nThis rule of construction by analogy is a dangerous one to follow in construing wills differently worded and executed in different surroundings\tRatio of the decision\nVide Sasiman v. Shib Narain 491\tRatio of the decision\nA. 2 5\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, out of respect for learned counsel on both sides who adopted the same method of approach we proceed to examine some of the important cases referred to by them\tRatio of the decision\nMr. Krishnaswami Iyengar sought to derive the greatest support for his contention from the decision in Ram Bahadur v. Jager\tPrecedent\nNath Prasad 3 Pat\tPrecedent\nL. J. 199\tPrecedent\nThe will there recited that if a daughter or son was born to the testator during his lifetime, such son or daughter would be the owner of all his properties but if there was no son or daughter, his niece S. would get a bequest of a lakh of rupees, and the rest of the movable and immovable properties would remain in possession of his wife until her death, and after her these would remain in possession of his niece\tPrecedent\nThe remainder was disposed of in the following words: - \"If on the death of my wife and my niece there be living a son and a daughter born of the womb of my said brother's daughter, then two-thirds of the movable property will belong to the son and one-third to the daughter\tPrecedent\nBut as regards the immovable property none shall have the lest right of alienation\tPrecedent\nThey will of course be entitled to enjoy the balance left after payment of rent\tPrecedent\nThis will was construed as conveying an absolute estate to the son and the daughter of the niece\tPrecedent\nIt was remarked that in spite of an\tPrecedent\nexpress restriction against alienation, the estate taken by S. (the niece) was an estate such as a woman ordinarily acquires by inheritance under the Hindu law which she holds in a completely representative character but is unable to alienate except in case of legal necessity and that such a construction was in accordance with the ordinary notions that a Hindu has in regard to devolution of his property\tPrecedent\nThe provisions contained in this will bear no analogy to those we have to construe\tRatio of the decision\nThe restraint against alienation was repugnant to both a life estate and a widow',-, estate and was not, therefore, taken into account\tRatio of the decision\nBut there were other indications in that will showing that a widow's estate had been given\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact that the gift over was a contingent bequest was by itself taken as a sure indication that the preceding bequest was that of a widow's estate\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no such indication in the will before us\tRatio of the decision\nReliance was next placed on the decision in Pavani Subbamma v. Ammala Rama Naidu (1937\tPrecedent\n1 M.L.J. 268\tPrecedent\n1936 Indlaw MAD 236\tPrecedent\nUnder the will there dealt with, the widow S, was to enjoy the properties and after her lifetime the properties were to be taken in the ratio of three to five by the son's daughter and the daughter's son respectively\tPrecedent\nA suit was instituted by the son's daughter for the recovery of possession of her share in one item of property forming, part of the estate which had been sold by S\tPrecedent\nThe question for decision in that case was whether S. was at all entitled to sell anything more than her life interest even for purposes of meeting a necessity binding upon the estate\tPrecedent\nVaradachari J. held that since in the will the gift over to the grand-children was of the entire Properties, and not a mere gift by way of defeasance, it had to be held that it indicated that the prior gift in favour of the widow was only of a limited interest\tPrecedent\nThis decision therefore goes against the contention of the learned counsel but he placed reliance on the observations made in the judgment when the learned Judge proceeded to say: \"In deference to the view taken in Maharaja of Kolhapur v. sundaram Iyer (1925) I.L.R. 48 Mad\tRatio of the decision\n1, it may be possible to create an interest analogous to a woman's estate in Hindu law notwithstanding the addition of a gift over and that the estate taken by S. need not necessarily be only a life estate in the English law sense of the term\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not understand how such passing observations can be helpful in deciding the present case\tRatio of the decision\nAssuming that it is possible to create a Hindu woman's estate not with standing the addition of a gift over, the question nevertheless whether that had been done in a given case must depend on the terms of the particular instrument under consideration\tRatio of the decision\nThe following remarks in the Privy Council decision in Nathu, Ram Mahajan v. Gangayabai (1938\tPrecedent\n2 M.L.J. 562 were next cited:-- \"As the will gave her the right to 'enjoy' the income of the estate during her lifetime, it was evidently contemplated that she should, as provided by -the Hindu law in the case of a widow, be in possession of the estate\tPrecedent\nSuch casual observation made in respect of a will couched in entirely different terms cannot afford much assistance in the decision of the case\tRatio of the decision\nIn Vasantharao Ammannamma v. Venkata Kodanda Rao Pantalu 1939\tPrecedent\nIndlaw MAD 621 (1940\tPrecedent\nM.L.J. 188, the next case cited, a Hindu testator who was a retired subordinate judge provided by his will as follows: \"Out, of the aforestated ancestral lands, the oneninth share to which I am entitled shall be enjoyed after my death by my wife till her death, and after her death it shall pass to S. son of my second elder brother deceased\tPrecedent\nMy self-acquired properties shall on my death be enjoyed by my wife till her death and after her death they shall pass to my daughter\tPrecedent\nThereafter they shall pass to my grandson through my daughter\tPrecedent\nThe will was construed as giving the self-acquired properties ultimately to the grandsons, and the estate of the daughter was likened to an estate which she would take- under the law of inheritance, that is a limited estate analogous to a widow's estate\tPrecedent\nAt page 193 of the report it was observed as follows: \"The question therefore arises, did he intend to confer only a life estate or a daughter's estate\tPrecedent\nIt seems to us that he meant to give a daughter's estate rather than a life estate\tPrecedent\nHe omits the words 'during her life' with reference to the disposition in favour of the daughter\tPrecedent\nThe words 'pass to my daughter' would rather indicate that in the ordinary course of devolution the estate should pass to her, that is, the daughter and then to the grandsons\tPrecedent\nThe words used in favour of the grandsons seem to indicate that the estate conferred on the daughter was not a life estate because there is no direct gift in favour of the grandsons, but on the other hand, what he says is that through his daughter the estate shall pass to his grandsons\tPrecedent\nEither he must have intended that the daughter should convey the property either by will or inter vivos to the grandsons or she having taken the estate, through her it should pass to the grandsons in the ordinary course of devolution\tPrecedent\nIf it was the daughter's estate that was intended to be conferred, there can be no question that the estate taken by the grandsons is not a vested interest\tPrecedent\nThis line of reasoning which appealed to the learned judges is not of much he]-) to us here as the language hi this will is quite different\tRatio of the decision\nIf the same line of reasoning is adopted here, the decision of the case would go against the client of Mr. K. S. K. Iyengar because in the will in this case the widow's estate is delimited by the words \"till your lifetime\tRatio of the decision\nReliance was next placed on Maharaja of Kolhapur v. sundaram Iyer (1925) I.L.R. 48 Mad\tPrecedent\nThat was a case of a government grant on the special terms set out therein and the question arose as to the nature of the grant\tPrecedent\nThere it was said that: \"the widows of Sivaji Raja got the gift of a life estate very much resembling the ordinary estate of a Hindu widow and with all the incidents of a widow's estate except the liability to be divested, but nevertheless a life estate rather than an estate of inheritance\tPrecedent\nThese remarks do not throw much light on the point before us\tRatio of the decision\nThe last decision referred to was the decision of the Privy Council in Mahomed Shumsool v. Shewukram 1874 Indlaw PC 12 (1874-75) 2 I.A. 7 There a Hindu inhabitant of Bihar by a document of a testamentary character declared his daughter who had two daughters, as his heir, and after her two daughters together with their children were declared heirs and malik\tPrecedent\nOne daughter of the daughter predeceased the testator without issue and the other daughter died after the death of the testator leaving an only son, the respondent in that case\tPrecedent\nIn a suit by the respondent against his grandmother the daughter of the 'testator for a declaratory order preserving unmolested his future right and title to the said lands, it was held that the daughter took an estate subject to her daughters succeeding her\tPrecedent\nIn this judgment the following observations were emphasized as relevant to this enquiry:- \"It has been contended that these latter expressions qualify the generality of the former expressions, and that the will, taken as a whole, must be construed as intimating the intention of the testator that Mst\tPrecedent\nRani Dhun Kaur should not take an absolute estate, but that she should be succeeded in her estate by her two daughters\tPrecedent\nIn other words, that she should take an estate very much like the ordinary estate of a Hindu widow\tPrecedent\nIn construing the will of a Hindu it is not improper to take into consideration what are known to be the ordinary notions and wishes of Hindus with respect to the devolution of property\tPrecedent\nIt may be assumed that a Hindu generally desires that an estate, especially an ancestral estate, shall be retained in his family; and it may be assumed that a Hindu knows that, as a general rule, at all events, women do not take absolute estates of inheritance which they are enabled to alienate\tPrecedent\nThese observations are unexceptionable but it may also be pointed out that it is open to a Hindu to confer a limited life estate on his widow or even a larger estate than a widow takes as an heir and that in every case he may not confer upon her by will a Hindu widow's estate which she would otherwise get by inheritance\tRatio of the decision\nGenerally speaking, there will be no point in making a will if what is to be given to a widow is what she would get on intestacy and cases do arise where a Hindu wishes to give to his widow a more restricted estate than she would get on intestacy or a much larger estate than that\tRatio of the decision\nThe question in every case cannot be determined merely on the theory that every Hindu thinks only about a Hindu widow's estate and no more\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is given must be gathered from the language of the will in the light of the surrounding circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel for the respondent followed the line adopted by Mr. Krishnaswami Iyengar\tArgument\nHe also on the analogy of other wills and the decisions given on their terms wanted a decision on the construction of this will in his favour\tArgument\nIn the first instance, he placed reliance on a decision of the Madras High Court in Ratna Chetty v. Narayana swami Chetty (19I4\tPrecedent\n26 M.L.J. 616\tPrecedent\nThere the testator made a will in favour of his wife providing, inter alia\tPrecedent\nall my properties shall after my death be in possession of my wife herself and she herself should be heir to everything and Mutha Arunachala Chetty (nephew) and my wife, should live together amicably as of one family\tPrecedent\nIf the two could not agree and live together amicably, my wife would pay Rs\tPrecedent\n4,000 and separate him\tPrecedent\nand then my wife would enjoy all the remaining properties with absolute rights\tPrecedent\nIf both of them would live together amicably, Muthu Arunachala Chetty himself would enjoy the properties which remain after the death of the widow\tPrecedent\nIt was held upon the construction of the will that the nephew, who lived amicably with the widow till his death, had a vested interest at testator's death which could not be defeated by a testamentary disposition by the widow in favour of a stranger\tPrecedent\nThis decision only decides that case and is not very relevant in this enquiry\tRatio of the decision\nReference was also made to the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Mst\tPrecedent\nBhagwati Devi v. Chowdry Bholonath Thakur (1874-75) 2 I.A 256\tPrecedent\nThis was a case of a gift inter vivos\tPrecedent\nThe gift to Mst\tPrecedent\nChunderbutti, his wife, was in these terms: \"the remaining 'milkiut' and 'minhai ' 'estates, together with the amount of ready money, articles, slaves, and all household furniture I have placed in the possession of Mst\tPrecedent\nChunderbutti Thakurain, my wife, to be enjoyed during her lifetime, in order that she may hold possession of all the properties and milkiut possessed by me, the declarant, during her lifetime, and by the payment of Government revenue, appropriate the profits derived therefrom, but that she should not by any means transfer the milkiut estates and the slaves; that after the death of my aforesaid wife the milkiut and household furniture shall devolve on Girdhari Thakur, my karta (adopted son\tPrecedent\nThe subordinate judge held that Chunderbutti got an estate for life with the power to appropriate profits and Girdhari got a vested remainder on her death\tPrecedent\nThe High Court took a different view and held that Chunderbutti took the estate in her character as a Hindu widow\tPrecedent\nThe Privy Council on this will held as follows: \"Their Lordships do not feel justified, upon mere conjecture of what might probably have been intended, in so interpreting it as materially to change the nature of the estate taken by Chunderbutti\tPrecedent\nIf she took the estate only of a Hindu widow, one consequence, no doubt, would be that she would be unable to alienate the profits, or that at all events, whatever she purchased out of them would be an increment to her husband's estate, and the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover possession of all such property, real and personal\tPrecedent\nBut, on the other hand, she would have certain rights as a Hindu widow; for example, she would have the right under certain circumstances, if the estate were insufficient to defray the funeral expenses or her maintenance, to alienate it altogether\tPrecedent\nShe certainly would have the power of selling her own estate; and it would further follow that Girdhari would not be possessed in any sense of a vested remainder, but merely of a contingent one\tPrecedent\nIt would also follow that she would completely represent the estate, and under certain circumstances the statute of limitations might run against the heirs to the estate, whoever they might be\tPrecedent\nTheir Lordships see no sufficient reason for importing into this document words which would carry with them all these consequences and they agree with the subordinate judge in construing it according to its plain meaning\tPrecedent\nThese observations have to a certain extent relevance to the present case but on the facts this case is also distinguishable\tRatio of the decision\nThis will was couched in different language than the will in the present case\tRatio of the decision\nThere was a clear prohibition, forbidding the widow to make any transfers of the milkiuit estates and the slaves\tRatio of the decision\nReference was also made to a decision of the Bombay High Court in Lallu v. Jagmohan (1898) I.L.R\tPrecedent\n22 Bom\tPrecedent\nThe will there ran as follows\tPrecedent\nWhen I die, my wife named Suraj' is owner of that property\tPrecedent\nAnd my wife has powers to do in the same way as I have absolute powers to do when I am present, and in case of my wife's death, my daughter Mahalaxmi is owner of the said property after that\tPrecedent\nIt was held that Suraj took only a life estate under the will, with remainder over to Mahalaxmi after her death and the bequest to Mahalaxmi was not contingent on her surviving Suraj, but that she took a vested remainder which upon her death passed to her heirs\tPrecedent\nAfter considering the rival contentions of the parties, we are of the opinion that no sufficient grounds have been made out for disturbing the unanimous opinion of the two courts below on the construction of this will\tRuling by Present Court\nBoth the learned counsel eventually conceded that the language used in the will was consistent with the testator's intention of conferring a life estate in the English sense as well as with the intention of conferring a Hindu widow's estate\tRatio of the decision\nIt was, however, urged by Mr. Rajah Iyer that as no express or implied power of alienation for purposes of all legal necessities was conferred on the widow, that circumstance negatived the view that the testator intended to confer upon his widow a Hindu widow's estate as she would get in case of intestacy\tArgument\nHe also emphasized that the words of the gift over to the daughter as supporting his construction which was further reinforced by the words of the will limiting the widow's estate \" till your lifetime \" and of the omission from therein of words such as nialik etc., while describing the widow's estate\tArgument\nMr. Krisbnaswami lyengar, on the other hand, contended that the absence of any words in the will restricting her powers of alienation and putting a restraint on them, suggested a contrary intention and that the daughter's estate was described as coming into being after the estate of the widow and was not conferred on her simultaneously with the widow, and this connoted according to the notions of Hindus a full Hindu widow's estate\tArgument\nIn our judgment, there is force in the contention of Mr. Rajah Iyer for reasons already stated and in the result, therefore, we dismiss this appeal with costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

35L of the Central Excise Act,1944\tFacts\nAppellants were engaged in the manufacture of biscuits classifiable under Sub-Heading 1905.11 of the Central Excise Tariff\tFacts\nThe biscuits were sold under the brand name \"Meghraj\".Under show cause notices it was alleged that the appellants herein (assessee) have sold the biscuits under the brand name \"Meghraj\",which was a registered trade mark of Kay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.who was using the said trade mark on manufacture of biscuits themselves,and,therefore,the appellants were not eligible to the benefit of SSI Notification No.1/93-CE dated 28.2.1993 as amended by Notification No.59/94-CE dated 1.3.1994\tFacts\nThe above show cause notices were issued by the Department demanding differential duty for the period April 1994 to June 1994 amounting to Rs.3,74,948/-plus short paid duty for the period April 1995 to May 1995 amounting to Rs.92,992.The said demand was based on an agreement detected by the Department\tFacts\nThat Agreement was between Madan Verma,Director of a company known as M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.,Ghaziabad,and M/s\tFacts\nRich Food Products (P) Ltd.,Noida\tFacts\nUnder the said Agreement M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.was\tFacts\nParty No.1.Under the Agreement\tFacts\nit was declared that M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.was the owner of the registered trade mark \"Meghraj\".Under the Agreement\tFacts\nit was stated that M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.was using the aforestated trade mark \"Meghraj\" for the manufacture of biscuits\tFacts\nUnder the Agreement there was a recital under which it was stated that M/s\tFacts\nRich Food Products (P\tArgument\nLtd.had put up a Unit for manufacture of wafers in Noida which it sought to manufacture under the brand name \"Meghraj\".Under\tFacts\nthe said Agreement M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.gave permission to M/s\tFacts\nRich Food Products Pvt\tFacts\nLtd.to use its trade mark for the manufacture of wafers alone\tFacts\nThe said agreement was valid for three years commencing from 22.11.1989\tFacts\nAt this stage,it may be noted that the appellants herein claim to have started manufacture of biscuits in 1991.The biscuits were sold in wrapper mentioning the name of the appellants,\"M/s\tArgument\nMeghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd.\" or \"Meghraj\".The Appellants claimed that it has been using the wrapper since beginning and since 1991 the use of the trade name or brand name \"Meghraj\" has never been challenged\tArgument\nThe Assistant Commissioner,Ghaziabad,examined the printed wrappers\tFacts\nHe came to the conclusion vide his orders that the trade name \"Meghraj\" was in the form of a logo printed on the wrapper of the biscuits and,therefore,the appellants were not entitled to the benefit of Notification No.1/93-CE dated 28.2.93 as amended by Notification No.59/94 dated 1.3.94.Consequently,the Adjudicating Authority called upon the appellants to pay differential duty for the period April 1994 to June 1994 amounting to Rs.3,74,948 plus short paid duty for the period April 1995 to May 1995 amounting to Rs.92,992\tFacts\nAggrieved by the decision of the Adjudicating Authority,the assessee preferred appeals to the Commissioner (A).The said appeals were rejected on the ground that the appellants were using the brand name \"Meghraj\" of another manufacturer M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.on their products (biscuits) and,therefore,they were not entitled to the benefit of exemption under Notification No.1/93-CE,as amended\tFacts\nIt was held that the word \"Meghraj\" was printed on all the printed wrappers and,therefore,it was wrong to say that the appellants were not using the brand name \"Meghraj\" on its products\tFacts\nIn this connection,reliance was placed by the Commissioner (A) on the said Agreement dated 22.11.89.Before the Commissioner (A) the appellants herein contended that they had used the name \"M/s\tFacts\nMeghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd.\" on the wrapper and not on the product\tFacts\nand,therefore,they were entitled to exemption\tFacts\nThis argument was rejected by the Commissioner (A) saying that the appellants were using the brand name \"Meghraj\" on their products\tFacts\nAccording to the Commissioner (A),the appellants used the trade name \"Meghraj\" in the form of a logo which was printed on the wrapper\tFacts\nBefore the Commissioner (A),it was argued in the alternative that the logo belonged to M/s\tArgument\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nthat the same was registered SSI Unit; that M/s\tArgument\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.was lying closed since 1.3.93 and,therefore,the appellants have been using that logo of M/s\tArgument\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.who was eligible for exemption under Notification No.1/93-CE,as amended\tArgument\nThis contention was rejected by the Commissioner (A) on the ground that under the Notification No.1/93-CE,as amended,exemption was not available to the specified goods bearing brand name or trade name (registered or not) of another person\tFacts\nSince,the appellants herein had used the trade name \"Meghraj\" on their products which trade name was owned by M/s\tFacts\nLtd.the appellants were not entitled to the benefit of exemption under Notification No.1/93-CE,as amended\tFacts\nAccordingly,the Commissioner (A) dismissed the appeals\tFacts\nThe orders of the Commissioner (A) have been confirmed by Order dated 11.4.2000 passed by CEGAT\tFacts\nHence,these civil appeals\tFacts\nTo complete the chronology of events,it may be pointed out that after the impugned decision of the Tribunal dated 11.4.2000,the appellants herein moved an Application for Rectification on 12.5.2000 (ROM No.72/2000).In that application it was urged on behalf of the appellants herein that the said brand name \"Meghraj\" did not belong to M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.; that the Department has failed to discharge its burden to prove that the trade name \"Meghraj\" belonged to M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.; that a mere Agreement between M/s\tFacts\nLtd.and M/s\tRatio of the decision\nRich Food Products (P) Ltd.would not be sufficient to prove that M/s\tFacts\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.was the lawful owner of the brand name\tFacts\nMeghraj\".In the Rectification Application\tFacts\nit was further pointed out that in fact the appellants had applied for ownership of the brand name \"Meghraj\" vide application dated 30.9.91 to the Registrar,Trade Marks under the Trade Marks Act and that the said application for registration was pending before the competent authority and since the above arguments were not recorded in the impugned Order of the CEGAT dated 11.4.2000 the same warranted rectification\tFacts\nBy Order dated 8.12.2000,CEGAT rejected the above Rectification Application made by the Appellants\tFacts\nOne more fact needs to be mentioned that on 30.6.2000 the Registrar of Trade Marks appears to have issued Registration Certificate on 30.6.2000 registering the trade mark \"Meghraj\" in favour of the appellants with effect form 30.9.91.It appears that issuance of this certificate was mentioned before the CEGAT which rejected the Rectification Application on 8.12.2000\tRatio of the decision\nNotification No.1/93-CE dated 28.2.93 was issued to help the SSI Units to survive in the market dominated by brand name/trade name\tRatio of the decision\nThe object of the Notification,therefore,was to help the SSI Units and thereby increased industrial production\tRatio of the decision\nUnder para '4' of the said Notification,the benefit of exemption was not available for excisable goods bearing brand name or trade name (registered or not) of another person\tRatio of the decision\nExplanation IX defined the word \"brand name\" or \"trade name\".The same is quoted hereinbelow\tRatio of the decision\nExplanation IX \"Brand name\" or \"trade name\" shall mean a brand name or trade name,whether registered or not,that is to say a name or a mark,such as symbol,monogram,label,signature or invented word or writing which is used in relation to such specified goods for the purpose of indicating,or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between such specified goods and some person using such name or mark with or without any indication of the identity of that person\tStatute\nNotification No.1/93-CE dated 28.2.1993 was subsequently amended by Notification No.59/94 dated 1.3.94.Para '7' of Notification No.1/93-CE as amended read as under: \"Para-7 The exemption contained in this Notification shall not apply to the specified goods where a manufacturer affixes the specified goods with a brand name or trade name (registered or not) of another person,who is not eligible for the grant of exemption under this Notification\tStatute\nIn the present case,as stated above M/s\tRatio of the decision\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd entered into an agreement on 22.11.89 with M/s\tRatio of the decision\nRich Food Products (P) Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nUnder that Agreement the Director of M/s\tRatio of the decision\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.declared that his company was the owner of the registered trade mark \"Meghraj\".The name of that Director is Madan Verma\tRatio of the decision\nHe is the Director of the appellants (company) also\tRatio of the decision\nFurther there is no evidence to show as to whether M/s\tRatio of the decision\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.was an \"eligible manufacturer\tRatio of the decision\nThis aspect is important since one of the arguments advanced by the appellants herein before the Commissioner (A) was that the trade mark belonged to M/s\tArgument\nLtd.,which was registered SSI Unit lying closed since 1.3.1993\tArgument\nNo explanation has been given as to why Madan Verma has not been examined by the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nHe has not been examined even on the question of alleged transfer of the trade mark in favour of the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIn the circumstances,we do not find any merit in this appeal\tRatio of the decision\nOn behalf of the appellants it has been vehemently argued that M/s\tArgument\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.was never the registered owner of the trade mark \"Meghraj\".It was urged that merely because an Agreement stood entered into on 22.11.89 between M/s\tArgument\nLtd.,the Department had erred in alleging that the trade mark belonged to M/s\tArgument\nIt was urged that M/s\tArgument\nLtd.had never got the trade mark registered under the Trade Marks Act\tArgument\nIt was urged that a false declaration was made by M/s\tArgument\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.under the above Agreement on 22.11.89\tArgument\nIt was urged that a mere agreement between two parties cannot constitute ownership of the trade mark in favour of M/s\tArgument\nIt was urged that in any event M/s\tArgument\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.had stopped its production in 1993; that the company had become defunct; that the appellants herein had applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks for registration of the mark \"Meghraj\" and vide registration certificate dated 30.6.2000 the Registrar has recognized the appellants as owner of the trade mark with effect from 30.9.91.In the circumstances,the appellants submitted that the demand for differential duty was unwarranted\tArgument\nWe do not find any merit in the above arguments\tPrecedent\nIn the case of Pahwa Chemicals Pvt\tPrecedent\nLtd.v\tPrecedent\nCommissioner of Central Excise,Delhi 2005 (189\tPrecedent\nELT 257 2005 Indlaw SC 799(SC\tPrecedent\nthis Court has held that the object of the exemption Notification was neither to protect the owners of the trade mark nor the consumers from being misled\tPrecedent\nThese are considerations which are relevant in disputes arising out of infringement/passing of actions under the Trade Marks Act\tPrecedent\nThe object of the Notification is to grant benefits only to those industries which otherwise do not have the advantage of a brand name\tPrecedent\nApplying the ratio of the above judgment to the present case,it is clear that grant of registration certificate under the Trade Marks Act will not automatically provide benefit of exemption to the SSI Unit\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of Commissioner of Central Excise,Chandigarh v\tPrecedent\nBhalla Enterprises 2004\tPrecedent\nELT 225 2004 Indlaw SC 996(SC),this Court held that the assessee will not be entitled to the benefit of exemption if it uses on goods in question,same/similar brand name with intention of indicating a connection with the goods of the assessee and such other person or uses the name in such manner that it would indicate such connection\tPrecedent\nIt was further held that the burden is on the assessee to satisfy the Adjudicating Authority that there was no such intention\tPrecedent\nApplying the above test to the facts of the present case,Madan Verma is a common Director in the two companies\tRatio of the decision\nHe has filed an affidavit enclosing the registration certificate dated 30.6.2000\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,in that Affidavit he has not stated as to on what basis,in the Agreement of 23.11.89 signed by him,he had declared that M/s\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.is the owner of the registered trade mark \"Meghraj\".There is no deed of assignment from M/s\tRatio of the decision\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.in favour of the appellants herein\tRatio of the decision\nThe Department has rightly placed reliance on the Agreement of 23.11.89.In the circumstances,the burden was on the assessee (appellants herein) to satisfy the Adjudicating Authority that there was no intention of indicating a connection with the goods of the assessee and such other person\tRatio of the decision\nBefore us it has been urged that M/s\tArgument\nLtd.is non-functional since 1.3.93 and,therefore,in any event appellants were entitled to use the trade mark \"Meghraj\tArgument\nThis argument is based on the concept of abandonment\tRatio of the decision\nWe do not find any merit in this argument\tRatio of the decision\nDiscontinuation of business in respect of a product does not necessarily amount to abandonment\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,there is no evidence from the side of the appellants indicating abandonment of the trade mark by M/s\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough,Madan Verma,the Director of M/s\tRatio of the decision\nKay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.,has filed his Affidavit enclosing the registration certificate,he has nowhere stated that M/s\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.has abandoned the trade mark\tRatio of the decision\nIn the circumstances,the Department was right in rejecting the above contention\tRatio of the decision\nAbandonment of the trade mark has to be proved by the appellants in the present case\tRatio of the decision\nThe burden is on the appellants,particularly,when the Department is relying upon the agreement dated 23.11.89 between M/s\tRatio of the decision\nLastly,we are required to examine the retrospective effect of the registration certificate dated 30.6.2000 with effect from 30.9.91.At the outset,we may reiterate that the object of the exemption Notification was neither to protect the owners of the trade mark nor the consumers from being misled\tRatio of the decision\nThese are considerations which are relevant in disputes arising under the Trade Marks Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe object of the exemption Notification No.1/93-CE was to grant benefits to those industries which do not have the advantage of a brand name\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,since retrospective nature of the registration certificate dated 30.6.2000 is repeatedly being raised in this Court we would like to examine the case law in this regard\tRatio of the decision\nThe Trade Marks Act,1999 has been enacted to amend and consolidate the law relating to trade marks,to provide for registration and better protection of trade marks and for prevention of the use of fraudulent marks\tRatio of the decision\nU/s.28 of the Trade Marks Act,1999,registration gives to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by the Trade Marks Act\tRatio of the decision\nIt is correct to say that the Registrar,Trade Marks,can issue registration certificate u/s.28 of the Trade Marks Act with retrospective effect\tRatio of the decision\nThe question before us is : what is the effect of issuance of registration certificate with retrospective effect\tRatio of the decision\nThis question has been decided by the Bombay High Court in the case of Sunder Parmanand Lalwani and Others v\tPrecedent\nCaltex (India) Ltd\tPrecedent\nAIR 1969 Bombay 24 1965 Indlaw MUM 1419 in which it has been held vide paras '32' and '38' as follows: \"A proprietary right in a mark can be obtained in a number of ways\tPrecedent\nThe mark can be originated by a person,or it can be subsequently acquired by him from somebody else\tPrecedent\nOur Trade Marks law is based on the English Trade Marks law and the English Acts\tPrecedent\nThe first Trade Marks Act in England was passed in 1875.Even prior thereto,it was firmly established in England that a trader acquired a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade,and that he was entitled to protect such right of property by appropriate proceedings by way of injunction in a Court of law\tPrecedent\nThen came the English Trade Marks Act of 1875,which was substituted later by later Acts\tPrecedent\nThe English Acts enabled registration of a new mark not till then used with the like consequences which a distinctive mark had prior to the passing of the Acts\tPrecedent\nThe effect of the relevant provision of the English Acts was that registration of a trade mark would be deemed to be equivalent to public user of such mark\tPrecedent\nPrior to the Acts,one could become a proprietor of a trade mark only by user,but after the passing of the Act of 1875,one could become a proprietor either by user or by registering the mark even prior to its user\tPrecedent\nHe could do the latter after complying with the other requirements of the Act,including the filing of a declaration of his intention to use such mark\tPrecedent\nSee observations of Llyod Jacob J.in 1956 RPC 1.In the matter of Vitamins Ltd's Application for Trade Mark at p.12,and\tPrecedent\nparticularly the following: \"A proprietary right in a mark sought to be registered can be obtained in a number of ways\tPrecedent\nThe mark can be originated by a person or can be acquired,but in all cases it is necessary that the person putting forward the application should be in possession of some proprietary right which,if questioned,can be substantiated\tPrecedent\nLaw in India under our present Act is similar\tPrecedent\nA person may become a proprietor of a trade mark in diverse ways\tPrecedent\nThe particular mode of acquisition of proprietorship relied upon by the applicant in this case is of his user for the first time in India in connection with watches and allied goods mentioned by him of the mark \"Caltex\",which at the material time was a foreign mark belonging to Degoumois & Co.of Switzerland and used by them in respect of watches in Switzerland\tPrecedent\nBefore the Deputy Registrar and before Mr\tPrecedent\nJustice Shah,proprietorship was claimed on the basis that the applicant was entitled to it as an importer's mark\tPrecedent\nSeveral authorities were cited and were considered and principles deduced and relied upon in that behalf\tPrecedent\nIn our opinion,it is not necessary in this case to go into details about facts in the various decided cases dealing with importer's marks\tPrecedent\nIn many of those cases,the dispute was between a foreign trader using a foreign mark in a foreign country on goods which were subsequently imported by Indian importers and sold by them in this country under that very mark\tPrecedent\nIn short it was a competition between a foreign trader and the Indian importer for the proprietorship of that mark in this country\tPrecedent\nWe have already reached a conclusion that so far as this country is concerned,Degoumois & Co.have totally disclaimed any interest in the proprietorship of that mark for watches etc\tPrecedent\nIn India,the mark \"Caltex\" was a totally new mark for watches and allied goods\tPrecedent\nThe applicant was the originator of that mark so far as that class of goods is concerned,and so far as this country is concerned\tPrecedent\nHe in fact used it in respect of watches\tPrecedent\nThere is no evidence that that mark was used by anyone else in this country before the applicant,in connection with that class of goods\tPrecedent\nUnquestionably,the applicant's user was not large,but that fact makes no difference,because so far as this country is concerned,the mark was a new mark in respect of the class of goods in respect of which the applicant used it\tPrecedent\nWe therefore,hold that the applicant is the proprietor of that mark\tPrecedent\nemphasis supplied\tPrecedent\nOn reading the above quoted paragraphs from the above judgment,with which we agree,it is clear that the effect of making the registration certificate applicable from retrospective date is based on the principle of deemed equivalence to public user of such mark\tRatio of the decision\nThis deeming fiction cannot be extended to the Excise Law\tRatio of the decision\nIt is confined to the provisions of the Trade Marks Act\tRatio of the decision\nIn a given case like the present case where there is evidence with the Department of the trade mark being owned by M/s\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.and where there is evidence of the appellants trading on the reputation of M/s\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.which is not rebutted by the appellants (assessee),issuance of registration certificate with retrospective effect cannot confer the benefit of exemption Notification to the assessee\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,issuance of registration certificate with retrospective effect from 30.9.91 will not tantamount to conferment of exemption benefit under the Excise Law once it is found that the appellants had wrongly used the trade mark of M/s\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of Consolidated Foods Corporation v\tPrecedent\nBrandon and Co.,Pvt.Ltd\tPrecedent\nAIR 1965 Bombay 35 1961 Indlaw MUM 91,it has been held vide paras '27' and '30' that the Trade Marks Act merely facilitates the mode of proof\tPrecedent\nInstead of compelling the holder of a trade mark in every case to prove his proprietary right,the Act provides a procedure whereby on registration the owner gets certain facilities in the mode of proving his title\tPrecedent\nWe quote hereinbelow paras '27' and '30' of the said judgment which read as follows: \"At any rate,it must be remembered that in this case I am not dealing with a passing-off action or an action for infringement of a trade mark which is alleged to be common property\tPrecedent\nThe case put up by the petitioner corporation that it was the first to use the mark \"Monarch\" in this country on its food products and that,in as much as the mark \"Monarch\" was admittedly a distinctive mark,it had acquired the right to get the mark registered in its name and also the right to oppose the application of any other trader in this country seeking to get that mark registered in his name in respect of the food products manufactured or sold by him\tPrecedent\nApparently,in such a case there is no question of infringement of any right of property in a trade mark for which any relief is sought,nor is there any question of passing-off,so that it might be necessary to enter into questions of nicety as regards whether there could or could not be any property in a trade mark\tPrecedent\nAs already stated by me while referring to the observations of Sir John Romily,it is not really necessary for me to decide in this case as to whether there could or could not be any property in a trade mark for the purpose of deciding this case\tPrecedent\nEven if it is found to be necessary to decide this question as to property in a trade mark,I have already pointed out that the Courts of Equity in England granted relief in cases of infringement of trade marks on the basis of infringement of the right of property in the trade mark\tPrecedent\nThere was no other basis on which those Courts could give any relief to the plaintiffs in such cases and for the purpose of such relief the Courts of Equity did not require the plaintiff to prove that his mark by any length of user was associated in the minds of the public with his goods\tPrecedent\nAll that was necessary for the plaintiff to prove was that he had used that mark in respect of his particular type of goods\tPrecedent\nThat was enough in the eyes of the Courts of Equity to entitle him to a relief by way of an injunction in case of an infringement of his mark by some other trader\tPrecedent\nI have also pointed out that the statute which came to be enacted in England in 1875 and the subsequent statutes did nothing more than to embody the rights in relation to trade marks which were already laid down by the Courts of Equity\tPrecedent\nAs a matter of fact,the statute enabled a person to have registered a mark not only which he had been using but also a mark which he proposed to use\tPrecedent\nThe latter type of mark would evidently refer to a distinctive mark,a mark which does not directly describe the nature or quality of the goods to which it is attached\tPrecedent\nIn cases of such marks,whereas the Courts of Equity did require some slight user before the proprietor thereof could institute an action for infringement thereof,the statute enabled the registration of such mark without any user at all,because such mark being distinctive per se it was not necessary for the person applying for its registration to show that mark had acquired a reputation in the market,so that it could be associated only with his goods and of nobody else\tPrecedent\nEven so far as this country is concerned,the Trade Marks Act of 1940 does not seem to have made any change in the legal rights of the owner of a trade mark as established by the Courts of Chancery in England\tPrecedent\nIn In re Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co\tPrecedent\nLtd.,49 Bom LR 52\tPrecedent\nAIR 1947 Bom 445),Chagla,J.(as he then was) observed in this connection : as follows \"The question is whether in India the Trade Marks Act of 1940 has made any change in the legal rights of the owner of a trade mark\tPrecedent\nTo my mind it is clear that even prior to the passing of this Act the owner of a trade mark could maintain an action for the infringement of a trade mark and that action could only be maintained on the assumption that he was the owner of the trade mark and he had a proprietary right in the trade mark\tPrecedent\nSub-cl.(I) of S.20 of the Trade Marks Act itself assumes and implies that such a right existed in the owner of a trade mark because it says that the unregistered holder of a trade mark can maintain a suit for the infringement of a trade mark provided that the trade mark was in use before February\tPrecedent\n25,1937,and an application for registration had been made and refused\tPrecedent\nAs regards the question whether there could be any property in a trade mark,the learned Judge further observed (on the same page) as follows: \"Again,turning to S.54 of the Specific Relief Act,which deals with cases when a perpetual injunction may be granted the Explanation to that section lays down that for the purpose of that section a trade mark is property\tRuling by Present Court\nTherefore,if a person invaded or threatened to invade the other's right to,or enjoyment of,property,the Court u/s.54 had the discretion to grant a perpetual injunction,and trade mark was as much property for the purpose of S.54 as any other kind of property\tRuling by Present Court\nI,therefore,agree with the learned Advocate General that all that the Trade Marks Act has done is to facilitate the mode of proof\tRuling by Present Court\nInstead of compelling the holder of a trade mark in every case to prove his proprietary right before he could ask the Court to grant him an injunction,the Trade Marks Act provides a procedure whereby by registering his trade mark the owner gets certain facilities in the mode of proving his title\tRuling by Present Court\nFor instance,under S.23 of the Trade Marks Act registration is to be prima facie evidence of the validity of the trade mark\tRuling by Present Court\nThis was precisely the view which was expressed by Lord Justice Romer in (1905) 1 K.B.592 to which I have already referred in the earlier part of the judgment\tRuling by Present Court\nTo summarise,therefore,a trader acquires a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with his goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade\tRuling by Present Court\nThe trader who adopts such a mark is entitled to protection directly the article having assumed a vendible character is launched upon the market\tRuling by Present Court\nAs between two competitors who are each desirous of adopting such a mark,\"it is,to use familiar language,entirely a question of who gets there first\tRuling by Present Court\nGaw Kan Lye v\tRuling by Present Court\nSaw Kyone Saing,AIR 1939\tRuling by Present Court\nRang 343\tRuling by Present Court\nFB).Registration under the statute does not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any greater right than what already existed at common law and at equity without registration\tRuling by Present Court\nIt does,however,facilitate a remedy which may be enforced and obtained throughout the State and it established the record of facts affecting the right to the mark\tRuling by Present Court\nRegistration itself does not create a trade mark\tRuling by Present Court\nThe trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the statute\tRuling by Present Court\nCommon law rights are left wholly unaffected\tRuling by Present Court\nPriority in adoption and use of a trade mark is superior to priority in registration\tRuling by Present Court\nIt was next contended by Mr\tArgument\nShavaksha that the respondent company had itself shown Kipre and Co\tArgument\nPrivate Ltd.,as\tArgument\nthe proprietors of the mark on the labels bearing the mark \"Monarch\" on the different kinds of its food products and,therefore,the respondent company had no right to apply for registration in its favours as if it was the proprietor thereof\tArgument\nIt was conceded by Mr\tArgument\nShah that the labels which were used on the food products manufactured by Kipre and Co\tArgument\nPrivate Ltd,did bear the name of Kipre and Co\tArgument\nPrivate Ltd.immediately below the mark \"Monarch\" and that the respondent company's name was printed below it as sole distributors\tArgument\nMr\tArgument\nShah,however,contended that by an agreement Ex\tArgument\nF.made between the respondent company and Kipre and Co\tArgument\nPrivate Ltd.in 1951\tArgument\nit was clearly provided that the mark \"Monarch\" belonged to the respondent company,that Kipre and Co\tArgument\nPrivate Ltd.were only to manufacture the food products as ordered by the respondent company and that the food products so manufactured were to be bottled and packed by them for its use and benefit and that,therefore,in spite of Kipre and Co.'s name appearing on the labels,the respondent company was the true proprietor of the mark \"Monarch\" and that,therefore,it was entitled to apply for its registration as proprietor thereof\tArgument\nNow,once again turning to the provisions of s.18 sub-section (I),it is clear that only a person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used by him or proposed to be used by him could make an application to the Registrar for the registration thereof\tStatute\nAccording to this provision,not only a person should claim to be the proprietor of a trade mark but he should prove that he had used it as such proprietor on his goods\tRatio of the decision\nThen turning to the label as it stood at the date of the application,two names appeared on the label,one of Kipre and Co.and the other of the respondent company\tRatio of the decision\nIf these two names had stood by themselves without any further description of either of them,it could be said that both Kipre and Co.and the respondent company were jointly the owners of the mark as well as the owners of the goods to which the label was affixed\tRatio of the decision\nBut,that is not the case\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondent company is described as the sole distributors on the label\tRatio of the decision\nThe reasonable inference that could be drawn from this description surely is that the goods were the property of Kipre and Co.and so also the mark\tRatio of the decision\nIf the respondent company was really the proprietor of the mark and also the owner of the goods one would expect some such words as \"Manufactured by Kipre and Co.for Brandon and Co.,Private Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nIn the absence of any such words,a person buying any of these goods on reading the label would naturally believe that what he was buying was the property of Kipre and Co.which was selling its goods under the mark \"Monarch\tRatio of the decision\nIt is true,as contended by Mr\tRatio of the decision\nShah,that even distributors and sellers may have marks of their own,but then,there are ways and ways of indicating on the label itself that the mark embodied therein is the mark belonging to such distributor or seller\tRatio of the decision\nObviously,therefore,on the label as it stood,it could not be said that the respondent company was the proprietor of the mark \"Monarch\" nor could it be said that the mark was used by the respondent company as proprietor thereof\tRatio of the decision\nApplying the principle of deemed equivalence we may clarify that if the SSI unit wrongly affixes a trade mark of another person,be it registered or not,or if it uses the trade mark of an ineligible person then such default would not be eliminated by the above principle of deemed equivalence embodied in S.28 of the Trade Marks Act,1999 as that principle is based on a deeming fiction which fiction is confined only to the provisions of the Trade Marks Act\tStatute\nBefore concluding we may refer to the Judgment of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise,Mumbai v\tPrecedent\nBigen Industries Ltd.2006 (197\tPrecedent\nELT\tPrecedent\n305 2006 Indlaw SC 546.In that matter a show cause notice was issued calling upon the assessee to show cause why the exemption be not denied to the assessee\tPrecedent\nIn para '19' of the show cause notice the authority accepted the existence of a deed of assignment\tPrecedent\nHowever,the show cause notice denied the exemption on the ground that Notification No.140/83-CE did not make any distinction between a brand name owned by a person in India or abroad\tPrecedent\nIn the present case,the facts are entirely different\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,there is no deed or assignment from M/s\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.to the M/s\tRatio of the decision\nMeghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd.(appellants herein).As stated above,there is no proof of acquisition on payment or consideration by the appellants to M/s Kay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,there is no evidence of assignment or licence from M/s\tRatio of the decision\nltd.to the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,we are concerned with the retrospective effect of the certificate issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks on 30.6.2000 with effect from 30.9.91\tRatio of the decision\nIn the circumstances,the judgment of this Court in the case of Bigen Industries 2006 Indlaw SC 546 (Supra) has no application\tRatio of the decision\nFor the aforestated reasons,we do not find any merit in these civil appeals\tRatio of the decision\nBefore concluding we may point out that we do not wish to express any opinion on the subsequent events which have taken place in this case\tRatio of the decision\nOur judgment is confined only to the period in question under the impugned show cause

India Council for Technical Education (hereinafter called the 'AICTE\tFacts\nThere was an inspection by a team of Professors of the University and it recommended favourably when it stated that the facilities provided by the appellant would be sufficient for establish-ing an Engineering College\tFacts\nThe AICTE sent a communication on 30.4.1995 stating that on the basis of the observations made by the Expert Committee and the recommendations made by the Central Regional Committee,State Level Committee and Central Task Force as per the provisions of the AICTE regulation dated 30.1.1994,the AICTE was granting conditional approval for establishing an Engineering and Technical College\tFacts\nThe abovesaid approval was subject to the fulfilment of specific conditions mentioned in Annexure I and the general conditions mentioned in Annexure II to the said letter\tFacts\nIn the event of contravention of the conditions,guidelines,norms and regula-tions of the AICTE,the AICTE could withdraw the approval at any time\tFacts\nUnder the impression that the State Govt.was to grant permission,the appellant requested the State Government by letter dated 24.6.1995 for permission to start the college\tFacts\nMeanwhile,the Mahatama Gandhi University by their letter dated 31.5.1995 forwarded to the Government a list of Colleges and Courses for affiliation during the academic year 1995-96.The appellant's college was shown as one of the colleges among the affiliated colleges for the said period\tFacts\nThe appellant sent a reminder to the Government on 26.8.1995 for permission for starting the college for the academic year 1995-96 and ultimately the Government refused permission by informing the appellant by a letter dated 16.8.1996 as follows :\tFacts\nIn inviting your attention to the reference cited,I am to inform you that Government regret their inability to comply with your request\tFacts\nThereafter,the appellant filed writ petition O.P.No.4612 of 1996 for quashing the said order and for a direction to sanction and establish an Engineering College\tFacts\nThe learned Single Judge of the High Court by his judgment dated 14.1.1997 allowed the writ petition,quashed the above-said order of the government dated 16.8.1996 and directed the Mahatama Gandhi University to consider the appellant's application for permanent affiliation without reference to the above letter of the Government and pass appropriate order within 8 weeks from the date of the receipt of a copy of the judgment\tFacts\nThe direction to pass a fresh order of affiliation was issued in view of the fact that the University contended before the learned Single Judge that unless the Government granted approval,permanent affiliation could not be granted\tFacts\nThe Government was also directed to reconsider its decision\tFacts\nAgainst the said judgment of the learned Single Judge the Commis-sioner and Secretary of the Government (Higher Education Department) filed Writ Appeal No.1024 of 1997.The Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Government and dismissed the writ petition\tFacts\nThe Division Bench,however,observed that the appellant was at liberty to make a fresh application to the Government of Kerala for according sanction for setting up the Engineering College or to request the Government to consider the earlier application,for a future academic year\tFacts\nIt is against the abovesaid judgment of the Division Bench that this appeal has been preferred\tFacts\nLearned senior counsel for the appellant\tArgument\nSri T.L.Vishwanatha\tArgument\nIyer contended that the Division Bench erred in reversing the well considered judgment of the learned Single Judge and according to him after the coming into force of the AICTE Act,1987,the statutes conferring power on the State or University to the extent they were inconsistent with the Central Act were void\tArgument\nIn so far as institutions imparting technical education were concerned,the University or the State Government had no independent role to play except to the extent provided in the above said enactment,in the present case,the AICTE had made inspections and was satisfied that the necessary infrastructure was available and that the appellant would be able to conform to the required standards of the education\tArgument\nThe AICTE had consulted the State of Kerala as well as the Mahatama Gandhi University\tArgument\nThe University had granted conditional approval,as stated earlier\tArgument\nTherefore the AICTE consti-tuted a Task Force and obtained its opinion and thereafter granted its approval on 13.11.1995 subject to various conditions\tArgument\nAccording to the learned senior counsel it was indeed not necessary for the appellant to have applied to the State Government for any further sanction to establish the college\tArgument\nIt might be that under the relevant statutes of the University,the University was required to obtain the \"views\" of the State Government but that did not amount to requiring any approval of the State Government and indeed if any such statute required the approval of the state Government,it would be void in view of what was stated by this Court in State of Tamil Nadu\tArgument\nAnother v\tPrecedent\nAdhiyaman Educational & Research Institute\tPrecedent\nOthers,[l995] 4 SCC 104.1995 Indlaw SC 1631\tPrecedent\nSri T.L.Viswanatha Iyer also contended that though the State Government stated in its counter affidavit filed in the High Court that the \"policy\" of the Government was not to grant approval to self-financing engineering colleges to be established,such a policy could not come in the way of the appellant in view of what this Court has stated in similar circumstances in Thirumuruga Kirupan & Variyar Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Education & Charitable Trust v\tArgument\nState of Tamil Nadu & Others,[1996] 3 SCC 15 1996 Indlaw SC 858\tArgument\nOn the other hand learned Additional Solicitor General Sri Mukul Rohtagi contended on behalf of the State of Kerala that the \"Policy\" of the State of Kerala at the relevant time was not to grant approval for establish-ment of more engineering colleges in the State\tArgument\nThe Government had clarified in the counter affidavit filed in the High Court that the Government \"was not in a position\" to take a decision to start new engineering colleges,without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering graduates from the State and without exploring the possibility of employment opportunities in the country as a whole\tArgument\nAlso there were four Engineering Colleges at Kannur,Trichur,Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram Districts and three Private (Aided) Engineering Colleges at Palakkad,Ernakulam (Kothamangalam) and Kollam Districts\tArgument\nThe Model Engineering College,Emakulam was a selffinancing Engineering College and others were the colleges at Changannur and Pathansamthitta and there was a self-financing engineering college at Kasargode\tArgument\nThere were also two unaided Engineering Colleges at Mallappuram and Thiruvananthapuram\tArgument\nEven though the appellant trust was not seeking aid from the Government and even assuming that it was financially self-sufficient,it would not be in the interests of the students & employment,to permit new engineering colleges to be established\tArgument\nThus the Government policy was not to grant fresh approvals\tArgument\nIf more approvals were granted,it might lead to commercialisation of education\tArgument\nThe following points arise for consideration : (1\tRatio of the decision\nWhether in view of the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu & Another v\tRatio of the decision\nAdhiyaman Educational & Research Institute & Others,[1995] 4 SCC 104 1995 Indlaw SC 1631,the provisions of the AICTE Act,1987 occupied the field and it was not necessary to obtain the further approval of the Government or other authority\tRatio of the decision\nWhether any statute in the State of Kerala if it required such approval,would be void\tRatio of the decision\n2) Whether the orders of rejection passed by the State Government were valid on merits and whether the University should have granted further orders to continue the affiliation solely on the basis of the AICTE permission\tRatio of the decision\nPoint 1\tFacts\nThis point is more or less covered by the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu\tPrecedent\nBut,in the context of s.10(K) regarding 'approval' for starting a technical institution,certain aspects of the judgment need to be highlighted\tRatio of the decision\nBefore we refer to the abovesaid judgment,it will be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the AICTE Act and the relevant regulations\tRatio of the decision\nThe abovesaid Act was an act to provide for the establishment of All India Council for Technical Education with a view to the proper planning and coordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country,the promotion of qualitative improvement of such education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical education system and for matters connected therewith\tRatio of the decision\nU/s.10 of the Act,it is stated that it is the duty of the Council constituted under the Act to take all steps as the said Council might think fit for ensuring coordinated and integrated develop-ment of technical education and maintenance of standards\tStatute\nFor the purposes of performing its functions under the Act,the Council may (a) undertake survey in various fields of technical education,collect data on all related matters and make forecast of the needed growth and development in technical education; (b) coordinate the development of technical education in the country at all levels; (c) allocate and disburse out of the Fund of the Council such grants on such terms and conditions as it may think fit to (i) technical

case\tRatio of the decision\nAs stated earlier,the above provisions of the AICTE Act,came up for consideration in State of Tamil Nadu v\tPrecedent\nAdhiyaman Educational & Research Institute,[1995] 4 SCC 104 1995 Indlaw SC 1631\tPrecedent\nIn the above matter,the State of Tamil Nadu granted permission on 17.4.84 to all private managements to start private Engineering colleges without financial commitment to government but subject to conditions\tPrecedent\nAt that time in 1984,the AICTE Act was not on the statute book\tPrecedent\nThe Government of Tamil Nadu granted permission to the Trust for the academic year 1987-88 to start an Engineering college\tPrecedent\nThe University also granted permission on 21.11.87 for the academic year 1987\tPrecedent\n88.Later on,these permissions were withdrawn by the State after issuing show cause on 16.7.89.So did the University on 26.7.89.But by that date,the AICTE Act,1987 had come into force\tPrecedent\nThe learned Single Judge and the Division Bench held in favour of the Trust and quashed and orders of the Government and the University\tPrecedent\nThe said judgments were affirmed by this Court\tPrecedent\nIt was held that the AICTE Act was referable to Entry 66,List\tPrecedent\nI of the Constitution of India,relating to \"coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions\".After the Constitutional Amendment (42 Amendment Act,1976) Entry 25 of List III in the Concurrent List\tPrecedent\nread : \"Education,included technical education,medical institution and Universities,subject to the provisions of Entries 63,64,65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour\".Thus,the State law under Entry 23 of List III would be repugnant to any law made by the Parliament under Entry 66 of List I,to the extent of inconsistency\tPrecedent\nThe Tamil Nadu Act was of 1976 and the University Act was of 1923 and were laws referable to the List\tPrecedent\nIII.Whether\tPrecedent\nthey were preconstitutional or a post constitutional laws,they would be repugnant to the AICTE Act passed by Parliament under Entry 66 of List\tPrecedent\nI.In the above case this Court referred to the various provisions of the AICTE Act and on the question of repugnancy held as follows\tPrecedent\nHence on the subjects covered by the statute,the State could not make a law under Entry 25 of List III after the Forty-Second Amendment\tPrecedent\nIf there was any such existing law immediately before the commencement of the Constitution within the meaning of Art.372 of the Constitution,as the Madras University Act 1923 on the enactment of the present Central Act,the provisions of the said law if repugnant to the provisions of the Central Act would stand impliedly repealed to the extent of repugnancy\tPrecedent\nSuch repugnancy would have to be adjudged on the basis of the tests which are applied for adjudging repugnancy u/art.254 of the Constitution\tPrecedent\nWe shall now refer to the above judgment dealing with the question of 'approval' for establishing technical institutions under s.10(K) of the AICTE Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe Tamil Nadu Rules of 1976 made under the 1976 Act had no doubt excluded technical institutions from the purview of the Rules but this Court pointed out that the Rules were capable of being amended so as to extend to such technical institutions and that if they were so extended,the State Act of 1976 and the Rules would require \"approval' by the State Government and that would be void\tRatio of the decision\nIt was stated that inasmuch as the State Act, \"will overlap and will be in conflict with the provisions of the Central Act in various areas\tRatio of the decision\ngranting approval for starting new technical institution\tRatio of the decision\ninspection of technical institution ............which are matters covered by the Central Act\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court then referred to the Madras University Act,1923.It was held that s.10 of the Central Act dealt with various matters (including granting approval for starting new technical institutions),and that so far as these matters were concerned\tRatio of the decision\nit is not the University Act and the University but it is the Central Act and the Council created under it which will have the jurisdiction\tRatio of the decision\nTo that extent,after the coming into force of the Central Act,the provisions of the University Act will be deemed to have become unenforceable\tRatio of the decision\nThus,in the two passages set out above,this Court clearly held that because of s.10(k) of the Central Act which vested the powers of granting approval in the Council,the T.N.Act of 1976 and the University Act,1923 could not deal with any questions of 'approval' for establishment of technical institutions\tRatio of the decision\nAll that was necessary was that under the Regulations,the AICTE Council had to consult them\tRatio of the decision\nStatutory powers of the State of Kerala and the M.G.University\tRatio of the decision\nThe question is as to how far the judgment in the Tamil Nadu case is to be applied in the State of Kerala\tRatio of the decision\nLearned Additional Solicitor General stated before us that there was no statute in the State of Kerala corresponding to the Tamil Nadu Act of 1976 nor any other law which specifically required the 'approval' of the State Government\tArgument\nIt was however contended that the Tamil Nadu case was concerned only with the standards of education and as to who could fix them\tArgument\nWe are not inclined to agree\tRatio of the decision\nWe have already pointed out under Point 1 that in the Tamil Nadu case,s.10(k) of the AICTE Act was referred to and the power of 'approval' for establishing a technical institution was considered,in our opinion,even if there was a State law in the State of Kerala which required the approval of the State Government for establishing technical institutions,such a law would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act and void to that extent,as held in the Tamil Nadu case\tRatio of the decision\nThe only provision relied on before us by the State Government which according to its learned senior counsel,amounted to a statutory requirement of 'approval' of the State Government,was the one contained in cl.9(7) of the Kerala University First Statute\tStatute\nIt reads as follows : \" Grant of affiliation : (1\tStatute\nAfter considering the report of the Commission and the report of the local inquiry,if any,and after making such further inquiry as it may deem necessary,the Syndicate shall decide,after ascer-taining the view of the Government also,whether the affiliation be granted or refused,either in whole or part\tStatute\nIn case affiliation is granted,the fact shall be reported to the Senate at its next meet-ing\tStatute\nIt will be noticed that cl.9(7) of the statute required that before the University took a decision on \"affiliation\",it had to ascertain the \"views\" of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nThe reference to the Commission in the above cl.9(7) is to the Commission of Inspection appointed by the University\tRatio of the decision\nSub-cl.(1) of cl.(9) of the statute required \"verification of the facilities that may exist for starting the new colleges/course\".The Commission was to inspect the site,verify the title deeds as regards the proprietary right of the management over the land (and buildings,if any) offered,building accommodation provided,if any,assets of the management,constitution of the registered body and all other relevant matters,Sub-cl.(2) of cl.(9) stated that the affiliation \"shall depend upon the fulfilment by the management of all the conditions for the satisfactory establishment and maintenance of the proposed institutional courses of studies and on the reports of inspection by the Commission or Commissions which the University may appoint for the purpose\tRatio of the decision\nAs held in the Tamil Nadu case,the Central Act of 1987 and in particular,s.10(k) occupied the field relating the 'grant of approvals' for establishing technical institutions and the provisions of the Central Act alone were to be complied with\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as the provisions of the Mahatma Gandhi University Act or its statutes were concerned and in particular statute 9(7),they merely required the University to obtain the 'views' of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nThat could not be characterised as requiring the \"approval' of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nIf,indeed,the University statute could be so inter-preted,such a provision requiring approval of the State Government would be repugnant to the provisions of s.10(k) of the AICTE Act,1987 and would again be void\tRatio of the decision\nAs pointed out in the Tamil Nadu case there were enough provisions in the Central Act for consultation by the Council of the AICTE with various agencies,including the State Governments and the Universities concerned\tRatio of the decision\nThe State Level Committee and the Central Regional Committees contained various experts and State representatives\tRatio of the decision\nIn case of difference of opinion as between the various consultees,the AICTE would have to go by the views of the Central Task Force\tRatio of the decision\nThese were sufficient safeguards for ascertaining the views of the State Governments and the Universities\tRatio of the decision\nNo doubt the question of affiliation was a different matter and was not covered by the Central Act but in the Tamil Nadu case,it was held that the University could not impose any conditions inconsistent with the AICTE Act or its Regulation or the conditions imposed by the AICTE.Therefore,the procedure for obtaining the affiliation and any conditions which could be imposed by the University,could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Central Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe University could not,therefore,in any event have sought for 'approval' of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nThus we hold,in the present case that there was no statutory require-ment for obtaining the approval of the State Government and even if there was one,it would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act\tRuling by Present Court\nThe University statute 9(7) merely required that the 'views' of the State Government be obtained before granting affiliation and this did not amount to obtaining 'approval'.If the University statute required 'approval',it would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act\tRatio of the decision\nPoint 1 is decided accordingly\tRatio of the decision\nPoint 2\tRatio of the decision\nFactual position and pleadings in this case\tRatio of the decision\nOn facts,the position was that the AICTE had granted approval on 30.4.95 expressly stating that this was \"on consideration of the observations made by the Expert Committee and the recommendations made by the Central Regional Committee,State Level Committee,Central Task Force as per the provisions of AICTE Regulations dated 31.10.94\".The AICTE had granted condition approval and the conditions were specified in Annexure\tFacts\nI to the order and the general conditions were enlisted in Annexure II.The\tFacts\nState Government was directed by the AICTE to announce admission in accordance with Regulation notified on 20.5.94 and based on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Unnikrishnan v\tFacts\nState of Andhra Pradesh,[1993] 1 SCC\tFacts\n645 1993 Indlaw SC 1168.The Mahatma Gandhi University had included this appellant in the list of colleges and courses which were granted affiliation during 1995-96 and the University had written to the State Government on 31.5.95 that as per statute 9(7),the \"views\" of the government were to be sent before granting affili-ation\tFacts\nThe letter said that for that reason the proposals of the University were being submitted to the Government \"for necessary action\".The appellant had sent a reminder on 26.8.95.The State in its letter dated 16.8.96 to the appellant merely stated \"that government regret their inability to comply with your request\".No reasons were assigned in the said letter\tFacts\nBut the State in its counter filed in the High Court tried to explain that the Director of Technical Education had opined that during the year 1995-96,it might not be practicable to start the college for the Director could not ascertain the details of the facilities available\tFacts\nIt was stated : \"he could not ascertain the infrastructural facilities provided by the appellant as per the norms prescribed by the All India Council of Technical Education\tFacts\nThe All India Council for Technical Education and the Mahatma Gandhi University have sought for the remarks of the State Government\tFacts\nPara 4 of the Counter affidavit had further stated that the Government was not \"in a position to take a decision to start new Engineering college without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering gradu-ates in the State and exploring the possibility of employment oppor-tunity in the country to the extent possible\tFacts\nThe State Government in its counter then gave the names of the existing colleges and their location\tRatio of the decision\nWe have already referred to these details\tRatio of the decision\nIt also observed that there was widespread student prospects against starting new colleges and it was necessary to be cautious in the matter of starting new engineering colleges\tRatio of the decision\nIt was stated that Government could not initially take a decision on the appellant's affiliation because of elections and that matter being one of 'major policy' the Government had subsequently \"taken a policy decision not to sanction any affiliation to such colleges either in the private sector or in the public sector for this year\".These are stated to be the reasons for the government's rejection by letter dated 16.8.96\tRatio of the decision\nState Government's refusal to grant permission is illegal and void on merits\tRatio of the decision\nAs already stated,in view of the judgment of this Court in Tamil Nadu case,it is obvious that there is no need to approach the State of Kerala for its approval for starting the Engineering colleges\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no power vested in the State under any State Law to grant approval and even if it was so vested,it would have been void in view of Tamil Nadu case\tRatio of the decision\nThis ground of repugnancy alone would be sufficient to quash the State Government's letter dated 16.8.1996 refusing to give their approval\tRatio of the decision\nEven on merits,the reasons given by the State Government in its counter are not tenable in law\tRatio of the decision\nThe Director of Technical Education of the State was a member of the State Level Committee as per regulation 9(4) of the AICTE Regulations\tRatio of the decision\nThe Secretary,Technical Education of the State of Kerala was also a member of that Committee\tRatio of the decision\nThe AICTE's approval dated 30.4.95 showed that the approval had been given by the State Level Com-mittee of which they were obviously members\tRatio of the decision\nIt is,therefore,not under-standable how the Director had given a contrary opinion to the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nRegulation 8(4) of AICTE only required calling for the \"com-ments/recommendations\" of the State Government and of the University\tRatio of the decision\nIn case,there was difference between the State Government,University or the Regional Committee the Central Task Force was to make a final recommen-dation under Regulation\tRatio of the decision\n8(4).Here\tRatio of the decision\nthe letter of approval of the AICTE dated 30.4.95 showed that the Central Task Force had given its approval\tRatio of the decision\nThe said approval was based also on the inspection by the Expert Committee of the AICTE.Hence the State Government in its counter,could not have relied upon any contrary opinion of the Director of Technical Education\tRatio of the decision\nIf the State Government had any other valid objections,its only remedy was to place its objections before the AICTE Council under the AICTE Act or before the Committees,e.g\tRatio of the decision\nState Level Committee etc\tRatio of the decision\nThe so called 'policy' of the State as mentioned in the counter affidavit filed in the High Court was not a ground for refusing approval\tRatio of the decision\nIn Thirwnuruga Kirupan and Variyar Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Education & Charitable Trust v\tPrecedent\nState of Tamil Nadu & Others,[1996] 3 SCC 15 1996 Indlaw SC 858,which was a case relating to Medical Education and which also related to the effect of a Central Law upon a law made by the State under Entry 25 List III,it was held that the \"essentiality certificate cannot be withheld by the State Government on any policy consideration because the policy in the matter of establishment of a new medical college now vests with the Central Government alone\tPrecedent\nTherefore,the State could not have any \"policy\" outside the AICTE Act and indeed if it had a policy,it should have placed the same before the AICTE and that too before the latter granted permission\tRatio of the decision\nOnce that procedure laid down in the AICTE Act and regulations had been followed under Regulation 8(4),and the Central Task Force had also given its favourable recommendations,there was no scope for any further objection or approval by the State\tRatio of the decision\nWe may however add that if thereafter,any fresh facts came to light after an approval was granted by the AICTE or if the State felt that some conditions attached to the permission and required by the AICTE to be complied with,were not complied with,then the State government could always write to the AICTE,to enable the latter to take appropriate action\tRatio of the decision\nDecision of University in not granting further or fined affiliation wrong on merits\tRatio of the decision\nAdmittedly,the University's inspection report was in favour of the appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThis is clear from the appellant's letter dated 31.5.95 to the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nThe only requirement as per the statute 9(7) was for the University to obtain the \"views\" of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nObtaining the 'views' of the State Government,as already stated,did not amount to obtaining its 'approval'.Procedure and conditions for affiliation could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Central Act,in particular s.10(k) of the Regulation,and the University could not seek approval of Government\tRatio of the decision\nThe University was also one of the agencies consulted by the council of the AICTE under Regulation 8.Once that was over,and approval was granted by the AICTE,if there was any default on the part of the College in compliance with the conditions of approval,the only remedy for the Univer-sity was to bring those facts to the notice of the AICTE so that the latter could take appropriate action\tRatio of the decision\nReliance for the respondent was placed upon the subsequent report of the Syndicate dated 7.8.97.This report no doubt pointed out that the appellant had not complied with certain conditions mentioned in the approval dated 30.4.95 granted by the AICTE.Assuming certain fresh facts had come to the notice of the University,it could only place the said facts before the AICTE\tRatio of the decision\nThus,the University ought to have considered the grant of final or further affiliation without waiting for any approval from the State Govern-ment and should have acted on the basis of the permission granted by AICTE and other relevant factors in the University Act or statutes,which are not inconsistent with the AICTE Act or its Regulations\tRatio of the decision\nFor the aforesaid reasons,we set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court and uphold the reasoning of the learned Single Judge in his judgment in OP 4612/96 dated 14.1.1997.We hold that the approval of the AICTE was sufficient,we do not also think that it was necessary for the learned Single Judge to direct the State Government to reconsider its decision\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned Single Judge's order quashing the letter of the State Government dated 16.8.96 is upheld\tRatio of the decision\nThe direction to the Mahatama Gandhi University to consider the application of the appellant for final affiliation or continuance of affiliation is confirmed and this is to be done on the basis of the approval granted by the AICTE dated 30.4.95,or any other relevant factors in the University Act or its statutes,which are not inconsistent with the AICTE Act or its Regulations\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeal is allowed and disposed of as stated above\tRuling by Present Court\nThere will be no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nM.JAGANNADHA RAO,J\tRuling by Present Court\nThe petitioner was not a party in the High Court of Kerala and this Special Leave Petition was filed with leave of this Court\tRatio of the decision\nWe find that the

Jalgaon Municipal Council, AIR (1991) SC 1153 1990 Indlaw SC 438 are kept out of lush field of administrative policy except where policy is inconsistent with the express or implied provision of a statute which creates the power to which the policy relates or where a decision made in purported exercise of power is such that a repository of the power acting reasonably and in good faith could not have made it\tRatio of the decision\nBut there has to be a word of caution\tRatio of the decision\nSomething overwhelming must appear before the Court will intervene\tRatio of the decision\nThat is and ought to be a difficult onus for an applicant to discharge\tRatio of the decision\nThe Courts are not very good at formulating or evaluating policy\tRatio of the decision\nSometimes when the Courts have intervened on policy grounds the Court's view of the range of policies open under the statute or of what is unreasonable policy has not got public acceptance\tRatio of the decision\nOn the contrary, curial views of policy have been subjected to stringent criticism\tRatio of the decision\nAs Professor Wade points out (in Administrative Law by H.W.R. Wade, 6th Edition) there is ample room within the legal boundaries for radical differences of opinion in which neither side is unreasonable\tRatio of the decision\nThe reasonableness in administrative law must, therefore, distinguish between proper course and improper abuse of power\tRatio of the decision\nNor is the test Court's own standard of reasonableness as it might conceive it in a given situation\tRatio of the decision\nThe point to note is that the thing is not unreasonable in the legal sense merely because the Court thinks it to be unwise\tRatio of the decision\nIn Hindustan Development Corporation's case1993 Indlaw SC 1085 (supra), it was observed that decision taken by the authority must be found to be arbitrary, unreasonable and not taken in public interest where the doctrine of legitimate expectation can be applied\tRatio of the decision\nIf it is a question of policy, even by ways of change of old policy, the Courts cannot intervene with the decision\tRatio of the decision\nIn a given case whether there are such facts and circumstances giving rise to legitimate expectation, would primarily be a question of fact\tRatio of the decision\nAs was observed in Punjab Communications Ltd. v. Union of India of Others, AIR (1999) SC 1801 1999 Indlaw SC 1548, the change in policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be justified on \"Wednesbury reasonableness\tPrecedent\nThe decision-maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy\tPrecedent\nIt is, therefore, clear that the choice of police is for the decision-maker and not the Court\tPrecedent\nThe legitimate substantive expectation merely permits the Court to find out if the change of policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made\tPrecedent\nA claim based on merely legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right\tPrecedent\nIts uniqueness lies in the fact that it covers the entire span of time; present, past and future\tPrecedent\nHow significant is the statement that today is tomorrows' yesterday\tPrecedent\nThe present is as we experience it, the past is a present memory and future is a present expectation\tRatio of the decision\nFor legal purposes, expectation is not same as anticipation\tRatio of the decision\nLegitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law\tRatio of the decision\nAs observed in Attorney General for New South wale v. Quinn, [1990] 64 Australian LJR 327 to strike the exercise of administrative power solely on the ground of avoiding the disappointment of the legitimate expectations of an individual would be to set the Courts adrift on a featureless sea of pragmatism\tRatio of the decision\nMoreover, the negotiation of a legitimate expectation (falling short of a legal right) is too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of a power when its exercise otherwise accords with law\tRatio of the decision\nIf a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power of violation of principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article 14 but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles\tRatio of the decision\nIt can be one of the grounds to consider, but the Court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference\tRatio of the decision\nIt depends very much on the facts and the recognised general principles of administrative law applicable to such facts and the concept of legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the Courts for the review of administrative action must be restricted to the general legal limitations applicable and binding the manner of the future exercise of administrative power in a particular case\tRatio of the decision\nIt follows that the concept of legitimate expectation is 'not the key which unlocks the treasure of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the gates which shuts the Court out of review on the merits,' particularly, when the elements of speculation and uncertainty are inherent in that very concept\tRatio of the decision\nAs cautioned in Attorney General for New South wale's case the Courts should restrain themselves and respect such claims duly to the legal limitations\tRatio of the decision\nIt is a well meant caution\tRatio of the decision\nOtherwise, a resourceful litigant having vested interest in contract, licences, etc. can successfully indulge in getting welfare activities mandated by directing principles thwarted to further his own interest\tRatio of the decision\nThe caution, particularly in the changing scenario becomes all the more important\tRatio of the decision\nIf the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be legitimate to take into consideration the national priorities and adopt trade policies\tRatio of the decision\nAs noted above, the ultimate test is whether on the touchstone of reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed\tRatio of the decision\nReasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of interest of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of persons upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract consideration\tRatio of the decision\nA restriction cannot be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case, it operates harshly\tRatio of the decision\nIn determining whether there is any unfairness involved the nature of the right alleged to have taken infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing condition at the relevant time enter into judicial verdict, the reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question\tRatio of the decision\nCanalisation of a particular business in favour of even a specified individual is reasonable where the interests of the country are concerned or where the business affects the economy of the country\tRatio of the decision\nSee Parbhani Transport Co-operative Society Ltd. v.

Chitralekha Etc\tRatio of the decision\nv. State of Mysore and Ors\tRatio of the decision\nAIR (1964\tRatio of the decision\nSC 1823 1964 Indlaw SC 103 held that the provisions of the Article were only directory and not mandatory in character and if they were not complied with it could still be established as a question of fact that the impugned order was issued in fact by the State Government or the Governor\tRatio of the decision\nClause (1) does not prescribe how an executive action of the Government is to be performed; it only prescribes the mode under which such act is to be expressed\tRatio of the decision\nWhile clause (1) is in relation to the mode of expression, clause (2) lays down the ways in which the order is to be authenticated\tRatio of the decision\nWhether there is any Government order in terms of Article 166; has to be adjudicated from the factual background of each case\tRatio of the decision\nIn order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel clear, sound and positive foundation must be laid in the petition itself by the party invoking and doctrine the bald expressions without any supporting material to the effect that the doctrine is attracted because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position relying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient to press into aid the doctrine\tRatio of the decision\nThe Courts are bound to consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public good at large, because while considering the applicability of the doctrine, the Courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present in the mind of the Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn Shrijee Sales Corporation and Anr\tPrecedent\nv. Union of India, [1997] 3 SCC 398 1996 Indlaw SC 1561 it was observed that once public interest is accepted as the superior equity which can override individual equity the principle would be applicable even in cases where a period has been indicated for operation of the promise\tPrecedent\nIf there is a supervening public equity, the Government would be allowed to change its stand and has the power to withdraw from representation made by it which induced persons to take certain steps which may have gone adverse to the interest of such persons on account of such withdrawal\tPrecedent\nMoreover, the Government is competent to rescind from the promise even if there is no manifest public interest involved, provided no one is put in any adverse situation which cannot be rectified\tPrecedent\nSimilar view was expressed in M/s\tPrecedent\nPawan Alloys and Casting Pvt.

because the resolution was announced for a particular period, it did not mean that the government could not amend and change the policy under any circumstances\tPrecedent\nIf the party claiming application of the doctrine acted on the basis of a notification it should have known that such notification was liable to be amended or rescinded at any point of time, if the government felt that it was necessary to do so in public interest\tPrecedent\nIn view of the factual position recorded by the High Court that at the point of time the appellants' units were set up and the commercial production started there was no assurance or promise\tRatio of the decision\nThe doctrine of promissory estoppel had no application to the facts of the case at that stage\tRatio of the decision\nWe find no substance in the plea that before a policy decision is taken to amend or alter the promise indicated in any particular notification, the beneficiary was to be granted an opportunity of hearing\tRatio of the decision\nSuch a plea is clearly unsustainable\tRatio of the decision\nWhile taking policy decision, the government is not required to hear the persons who have been granted the benefit which is sought to be withdrawn\tRatio of the decision\nThe question of legitimate expectation arises according to the appellants after the benefits were granted by the concerned G.O.Ms\tRatio of the decision\nAt this juncture we would like to take note to certain factual positions highlighted by the appellants which are practically undisputed by the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nContrary to what the High Court has stated, it appears from record that counter affidavits were filed\tRatio of the decision\nThe reasons which have weighed with the High Court to uphold the action of the State were not pleaded before the High Court specifically, and the High Court cull out those from the files which were produced before it\tRatio of the decision\nThough the appellants were not entitled to any opportunity of hearing before alteration of the benefits flowing from the notifications or withdrawal of any benefit, yet when the State has not taken any specific stand justifying the withdrawal and the High Court referred to the files to put its seal of proof, notwithstanding non-requirement for granting any opportunity before the withdrawal, principles of natural justice certainly were applicable, since the High Court with reference to the files recorded findings on the basis thereof\tRatio of the decision\nAs noted above no specific grounds or reasons were indicated to justify the withdrawal in the affidavits filed before the Tribunal or the High Court, as the case may be\tRatio of the decision\nAs the correctness of factual basis justifying withdrawal is in issue, fair play certainly warranted grant of opportunity to the appellants to present its side of the picture\tRatio of the decision\nFurther, a definite plea was taken that there was no scope for retrospective withdrawal of benefit by an executive order\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court has not dealt with the issue\tRatio of the decision\nThe same also needs to be examined\tRatio of the decision\nAbove being the position, decision of the High Court by placing reliance on the files to hold that the withdrawal was justified, is not tenable in law and in the fitness of things, the High Court should hear the matter afresh and taken decision on those two issues\tRatio of the decision\nIt is made clear that we have not expressed any opinion on those issues on the facts of the present case\tRatio of the decision\nIt is to be noted that no privilege was claimed from production of the file as the files were produced before the High Court and in fact the High Court referred to the materials on the files to affirm State's action\tRatio of the decision\nWe direct that the State Government, if it so chooses, shall file its further counter-affidavits before the High Court within six weeks from today indicating the reasons which warranted the withdrawal of the benefits extended\tRatio of the decision\nThe plea of the appellants regarding legitimate expectation shall be considered by the High Court in the light of materials to be placed by the respondents by affidavits as directed above\tRatio of the decision\nWe make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the factual aspects except indicating the principles underlying legitimate expectation\tRatio of the decision\nAnother point which was specifically raised before the High Court but has not been dealt by it is the legality of the action in directing retrospective withdrawal of the benefit by a letter of the Government\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the same is permissible in law has to be decided by the High Court\tRatio of the decision\nTo the aforesaid limited extent, the matter is remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration\tRuling by Present Court\nThe appeals are disposed

            "text": "This appeal by Special Leave arises out of a judgment and order dated 1st March,2005\tFacts\nrendered by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay,whereby the learned Single Judge has set aside the order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal,holding that they did not have jurisdiction to entertain and try the claim and counter claim made by the parties\tFacts\nIn order to appreciate the issue,requiring determination,a few relevant facts may be stated\tFacts\nThe appellant M/s\tFacts\nBharat Petroleum Corporation Limited is a Government of India Undertaking,under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas and is engaged in refining,distributing and selling of petroleum products all over the country\tFacts\nThe respondent M/s\tFacts\nGreat Eastern Shipping Company Limited is engaged in the business of shipping and allied activities and owns a fleet of tanker vessels for charter,including the vessel known as JAG PRAJA\tFacts\nAn agreement,called the Time Charter Party in legal parlance,was entered into between the appellant and the respondent on 6th May,1997 for letting on hire vessels for a period of two years from 22nd September,1996 to 30th June,1997 and from 1st July,1997 to 30th June,1998,on the terms and conditions set out in the said agreement\tFacts\nHowever,before the Charter Party was to come to an end,on 29th June,1998,the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (for short IOC ),acting as agent of the appellant,issued a fax to various ship owners,including the respondent herein,requesting them to extend the validity of the Charter Party Agreement dated 6th May,1997 beyond 30th June,1998 for a period of one month from 1st July,1998 with option for two further extensions of 15 days each\tFacts\nThe respondent agreed to the said proposal\tFacts\nAccordingly,on 29th June,1998 an addendum was signed between the parties whereby the validity period of Charter Party was extended for one month with an option for two further extensions for a period of 15 days each\tFacts\nThe terms and conditions; exceptions and exemptions contained in the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 remained unaltered\tFacts\nThe parties are ad idem that the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 was extended till 31st August,1998\tFacts\nIt appears that since Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 was coming to an end on 31st August,1998,the Oil Companies sought permission of the Oil Co-ordination Committee,a wing of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for further extension of the Charter Party\tFacts\nHowever,the Oil Coordination Committee,by their fax message dated 26th August,1998,declined the request of the Oil Companies,including the appellant,for further extension of Charter Party beyond 31st August,1998.The said fax message was an internal communication between the Oil Coordination Committee and the Oil Companies\tFacts\nThereafter,in September,1998,the IOC for and on behalf of the Oil Industry,floated a fresh tender for carriage of petroleum products along the Indian coast on time charter basis for a period of one year commencing from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999,on the terms and conditions set out in the tender document\tFacts\nIn response to the said tender,the respondent and other vessel owners submitted their bids\tFacts\nIt seems that being aggrieved of the decision of the IOC to invite revised price bids after opening of the sealed tenders,one of the bidders filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court,questioning the said decision\tFacts\nThe appellant intervened in the said matter\tFacts\nThe writ petition was disposed of vide order dated 20th August,1999.While disapproving in principle,the action of the IOC in inviting fresh price bids after opening the bids,but without recording final opinion on the merits of the issues raised in writ petition,the Court disposed of the petition,inter alia,directing that (i) the charter hire rates should be fixed by the Tender Evaluation Committee and (ii) as the tender was for the period ending 31st August,1999 and the writ petition was being decided on 20th August,1999,the IOC will not be required to enter into a contract for the period from 1st September,1998\tRuling by Lower Court\nto 31st August,1999.It is not in dispute that the vessel JAG PRAJA ,with which we are concerned,continued to be chartered by the appellant till 31st August,1999\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt appears that pending finalization of a new charter party for the period commencing 1st September,1998,certain meetings took place between the Oil Companies and the Ship Owners,including the respondent herein\tFacts\nOn 12th October,1998,the respondent informed the IOC that if all its nine vessels,mentioned in the letter,are used at a fair and reasonable rate for one year,from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 for which the tender had been floated,they were agreeable to apply the new agreed rates for use of the said nine vessels from 1st July,1998.On 31st October,1998\tFacts\nthe IOC faxed to the respondent relevant portion of the message received by them from Oil Co-ordination Committee,extending the period of usage of the existing coastal tanker fleet for the month of October,1998,at 80% charter hire rates,prevailing till 30th June,1998,on provisional basis,subject to adjustment of provisional charter hire with retrospective date from 1st September,1998 against the revised charter hire,to be finalised by the Oil Industry in response to the tender floated by IOC on 1st September,1998.Respondent s consent was asked for\tFacts\nThe respondent responded immediately vide their letter dated 5th November,1998,agreeing in principle that revised charter hire rates,as and when finalized in response to tender floated by the IOC on 1st September,1998,would be applicable to the vessels which are selected under the tender,retrospectively from 1st September,1998.It was pointed out that the vessels which are not chartered under the tender floated would be at a disadvantage\tFacts\nIt was clearly stated that since the tender was not finalized,the owners will be guided by the existing terms and conditions\tFacts\nSome other objections,not relevant at this stage,were also indicated\tFacts\nAs such,all said and done,Oil Co-ordination Committee s proposal was not accepted\tFacts\nNevertheless,some suggestions to resolve the controversy were given\tFacts\nThus,the proposal by the Oil Co-ordination Committee was not accepted by the respondent\tFacts\nIn the alternative,it was suggested by the respondent that the charter period be extended by six months on the existing terms and conditions at a mutually discussed time charter rate\tFacts\nAdmittedly,the vessels continued to be chartered by the appellant beyond the date of this letter\tFacts\nThereafter,for almost two months,there was no communication between the parties\tFacts\nIt was only on 31st December,1998 when the IOC issued a fax to the respondent,enclosing draft letter regarding charter party agreement to be signed between the charterers and owners (with minor modification,if necessary),requesting the respondent to sign as per proposal by the 4th January,1999,on which date the respondent expressed its disinclination,stating in reply fax that as per usual practice,pending finalization of new charter,the existing terms and conditions of the charter party continue to apply\tFacts\nFinally,it was suggested that: \"We,therefore,suggest that we sign an agreement with you for the period from 1st September,1998 until the matter is finally decided by you under the tender on the existing terms and conditions with the charter hire being provisionally paid on an ad hoc basis at 90% of the rate which was prevailing under the existing Charter Party\tFacts\nKindly confirm in order to draw up a suitable agreement accordingly\tFacts\nEmphasis supplied\tFacts\nVide letter of even date,i.e.4th January,1999,the appellant suggested to the respondent that in the absence of a formal charter party with effect from 1st September,1998,a provisional arrangement for a period of four months effective from 1st September,1998 with an option for extension of one month may be mutually agreed to by payment at the rate of 80% on charter hire prevailing on 30th June,1998,as ad hoc hire\tFacts\nThe respondent was asked to convey their acceptance to the said suggestion\tFacts\nIt appears that the respondent did not respond to the said suggestion by the appellant but all the same its vessel continued to be on charter with the appellant\tFacts\nThe writ petition was ultimately disposed of on 20th August,1999.It was only after a gap of about seven months that on 15th March,2000,the IOC informed the respondent about the evaluation of the tenders in terms of the order passed by the High Court\tFacts\nCharter hire rate worked out by the Committee for vessel JAG PRAJA for the period from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 was communicated to the respondent\tFacts\nIn response,the respondent,while expressing their disappointment with the rate but purportedly,in view of their long business relations with the appellant conveyed their acceptance of the proposed rate in respect of each of the vessels named in separate letters,all dated 1st\tFacts\nMay,2000,with the expectation that their outstanding balance of the hire shall be paid to them at the earliest\tFacts\nHowever,the respondent did not convey their acceptance of the charter hire rates for two vessels,viz\tFacts\nJAG PRAJA and JAG PRAYOG\tFacts\nIt appears that the respondent wrote various letters to the appellant for upward revision of the rate in respect of these two vessels but seemingly their request was ultimately turned down on 2nd November,2000,on receipt of which,the respondent slammed a legal notice dated 6th November,2000,on the appellant,inter alia,requesting them to revise the rates on the basis of mutual discussions and settle the accounts\tFacts\nHaving failed to receive any reply to the said notice,by another legal notice dated 1st December,2000,the respondent called upon the appellant to pay balance amount of Rs.43,947,517/-to them as charter hire in respect of vessel JAG PRAJA for the period from 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 within 15 days from date of receipt of the said notice or treat it as an arbitration notice\tFacts\nThe name of the arbitrator was also communicated to the appellant\tFacts\nIt seems that pursuant to the said notice and some subsequent correspondence exchanged between the parties,an Arbitral Tribunal was constituted\tFacts\nClaims and counter claims were filed before the Arbitral Tribunal\tFacts\nOn the basis of the pleadings of the parties,the Arbitral Tribunal framed as many as eight issues\tFacts\nHowever,arguments were heard only on the following three issues\tFacts\nIssue No.1:-Whether the Hon ble Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent for the period September,1998 to August,1999\tRatio of the decision\nin respect of the vessel Jag Praja for the reasons stated in para 1 of the written statement\tRatio of the decision\nIssue No.2:-Whether there is any common practice that if the vessel is not re-delivered at the end of the period mentioned in the time charter the vessel would be governed by the charter party under which originally it was chartered\tRatio of the decision\nIssue\tRatio of the decision\nNo.5:-Whether the time charter party dated 6th\tRatio of the decision\nMay,1997 came to an end by efflux of time on 30th August,1998\tRatio of the decision\nVide order dated 12th\tFacts\nMay,2003 the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that the appellant having invoked the arbitration clause contained in charter party agreement dated 6th May,1997,which was valid upto 31st August,1998\tFacts\nand as the dispute between the parties related to the period subsequent to 31st\tFacts\nAugust,1998,they had no jurisdiction to decide the Reference\tFacts\nThe learned Tribunal found issue No.2 in the negative and issue No.5 in the affirmative\tFacts\nAccording to the Tribunal on and after 1st September,1998,charter party agreement dated 6th May,1997 was superseded by a fresh agreement and a term of the agreement was that the charter hire rate would be determined by the Oil Co-ordination Committee of the IOC.In nutshell,the Tribunal was of the view that with the performance,original charter party dated 6th May,1997 got extinguished\tFacts\nThe respondent challenged the said Award before the High Court\tFacts\nBy the impugned order,the learned Single Judge has set aside the said Award,inter alia,holding that Arbitral Tribunal has the jurisdiction to adjudicate the disputes between the parties as the vessel continued to be hired by the appellant for the period subsequent to 31st August,1998 on the same terms and conditions,as were contained in the charter party dated 6th May,1997,only subject to the revision or modification of the rate of hire to be determined by the Oil Co-ordination Committee\tFacts\nThe learned Judge also felt that the Tribunal had erred in totally excluding from its consideration cls.23 and 4.1 of the charter party dated 6th May,1997,whereunder the charter party was to come to an end on re-delivery of the vessel\tFacts\nAdmittedly,after 31st August,1998,re-delivery of vessel did not take place and,therefore,in terms of clause 23,the vessel continued to be hired on the same terms and conditions except the term as to the hire charges,on which there was disagreement between the parties\tFacts\nIt was thus,held that the charter party dated 6th May,1997 did not come to an end by efflux of time and it was extended by the parties on the same terms and conditions except the rate of hire\tFacts\nCorrectness of this order of the High Court is questioned in this appeal\tRatio of the decision\nMr\tArgument\nSudhir Chandra,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has assailed the impugned order on the sole ground that the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 having come to an end by efflux of time on 31st August,1998,the arbitration clause contained in it also perished and,therefore,in the absence of a fresh arbitration agreement,claim of the respondent relating to the period 1st September,1998 to 31st August,1999 could not be referred to arbitration by invoking arbitration clause in Charter Party dated 6th May,1997.Laying emphasis on the fax message dated 26th August,1998 addressed by the Oil Co-ordination Committee to the oil companies,including the appellant,inter alia,informing them that no further extension of the Current Charter Hire Rate will be allowed,learned counsel submitted that the said message made it clear to all concerned that Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 would not be extended under any circumstance\tArgument\nShyam Divan,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent,on the other hand,submitted that notwithstanding the fact that the period fixed originally under the Charter Party or under the Addendum dated 29th June,1998 had come to an end,the subsequent conduct of the parties goes to show that charter of the vessel by the appellant beyond 31st August,1998 continued to be governed by the terms and conditions stipulated in charter party dated 6th May,1997 and,therefore,an arbitration agreement did exist between the parties\tArgument\nLearned counsel argued that even otherwise till the vessel was not re-delivered in terms of Cls.4 and 23 of Charter Party dated 6th May,1997,the said agreement could not come to an end\tArgument\nIt was pointed out that all the obligations of the owners as well as of the charterers during the period the vessel was in use continued to be discharged under the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 even after the expiry of the period of the Charter Party\tArgument\nIn support of the proposition that the concurrence of a party can be gathered from his conduct,like continued user of the vessel in the present case,without any objection to respondent s letter dated 4th January,1999,reliance is placed on a decision of this Court in The Godhra Electricity Co\tArgument\nLtd.& Anr\tArgument\nVs\tArgument\nThe State of Gujarat & Anr 1974 Indlaw SC 253\tArgument\nIt was also submitted that the view taken by the High Court being a plausible view,interference in exercise of extra-ordinary jurisdiction u/art.136 of the Constitution is unwarranted\tArgument\nThus,the short question for determination is whether on the expiry of the extended period of charter hire on 31st August,1998,Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 came to an end and the arbitration agreement between the parties perished with it\tRatio of the decision\nBefore we proceed to examine the rival stands,we may note,at the outset,that neither the Arbitral Tribunal nor the High Court have gone into the question whether the claim made by the respondent would otherwise fall within the ambit of the arbitration clause in the Charter Party or not\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is in dispute is whether the arbitration agreement between the parties had got extinguished after 31st August,1998,i.e.the date of expiry of the extended period of the Charter Party\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,we refrain from expressing any opinion on the scope and ambit of the arbitration clause though,prime facie,it appears to be quite widely worded\tRatio of the decision\nIt is,no doubt,true that the general rule is that an offer is not accepted by mere silence on the part of the offerree,yet it does not mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words\tRatio of the decision\nUnder certain circumstances,offerree s silence,coupled with his conduct,which takes the form of a positive act,may constitute an acceptance an agreement sub silentio\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the terms of a contract between the parties can be proved not only by their words but also by their conduct\tRatio of the decision\nIn our view,the principle of sub silentio is clearly attracted in the present case\tRatio of the decision\nAs noted above,after the extended period of Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 had come to an end on 31st August,1998\tRatio of the decision\nand the bids received pursuant to fresh invitation were pending finalization,vide their letter dated 12th\tRatio of the decision\nOctober,1998,the respondent had informed the appellant that they were agreeable to apply new rates for use of the vessel from 1st July,1998 provided all the nine vessels are used\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,on 31st October,1998,the appellant faxed IOC s message informing them of the extension of the existing coastal tanker fleet for the month of October,1998 at reduced rates,viz.80% of the Charter Party rates prevailing till 30th August,1998.On receipt of the said letter,the respondent vide their letter dated 5th November,1998,protested against the revision of the rates for the vessel not being considered under the new bid and stated in unequivocal terms that it was not possible for them to accept the proposal of the Oil Co-ordination Committee,communicated to them vide letter dated 12th\tRatio of the decision\nOctober,1998.Yet again while responding to appellant s fax dated 31st December,1998,whereby the respondent was required to sign a provisional charter party by 4th January,1999,vide their letter dated 4th January,1999,the respondent,pointed out to the appellant that usual practice is that pending finalization of the new Charter,the existing terms and conditions of the Charter Party continue to apply and,therefore,they were willing to sign the agreement as contemplated by the appellant based on the existing terms and conditions\tRatio of the decision\nIt was suggested that an agreement may be signed between them for the period from 1st September,1998 until the matter was finally decided by the appellant under the tender,on the existing terms and conditions with the charter hire being provisionally paid on ad hoc basis at 90% of the rate which was prevailing under the existing Charter Party\tRatio of the decision\nAs noted hereinabove,there was no response by the appellant to respondent s letter dated 4th January,1999 though it appears that vide their letter of even date,the appellant did suggest to the respondent that as a token of formal agreement the said letter may be jointly signed by the charterers and the vessel owners\tRatio of the decision\nAdmittedly,no such agreement was signed between the parties\tRatio of the decision\nIndubitably,there was no further exchange of correspondence between the parties during the year\tRatio of the decision\nNevertheless,the appellant continued to use the vessel on hire with them under the time charter dated 6th May,1997.The conduct of the parties,as evidenced in the said correspondence and,in particular appellant s silence on respondent s letters dated 5th November,1998 and 4th\tRatio of the decision\nJanuary,1999,coupled with the fact that they continued to use the vessel,manifestly goes to show that except for the charter rate,there was no other dispute between the parties\tRatio of the decision\nThey accepted the stand of the respondent sub silentio and thus,continued to bind themselves by other terms and conditions contained in the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997,which obviously included the arbitration clause\tRatio of the decision\nWe may examine the issue from another angle,based on respondent s stand that charter party dated 6th May,1997 continues to be in vogue till the chartered vessel is re-delivered\tRatio of the decision\nIn this context,it would be appropriate to refer to Cls.4 and 23 of the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997.These are in the following terms: \"4.Delivery & Redelivery 4.1\tStatute\nThe vessel shall continue to be on charter to charterers in direct continuation from 2348 hrs.22.09.1996 to 30.06.1998.The vessel shall be re-delivered by charterers to owners on dropping last outward pilot at any port on west coast of India at charterers option\tStatute\nCharterers to give owners 15 days notice to probable port of re-delivery\tStatute\n4.2 Charterers to load last three cargoes clean and re-deliver the vessel in clean condition\tStatute\nFinal Voyage Should the vessel be on her voyage towards the port of redelivery at the time of payment of hire is due,payment of hire shall be made for such length of time as Owners and Charterers may agree upon as being estimated time necessary to complete the voyage,less any disbursements made or expected to be made or expenses incurred or expected to be incurred by Charterers for owners account and less the estimated amount of bunker fuel remaining at the termination of the voyage and when the vessel is redelivered any overpayment shall be refunded by the owners or underpayment paid by Charterers\tRatio of the decision\nNotwithstanding the provisions of cl.4 hereof should the vessel be upon voyage at the expiry of the period of this charter,Charterers shall have the use of vessel at the same rate and conditions for such extended time as may be necessary for the completion of the round voyage on which she is engaged and her return to a port of redelivery as provided by the Charter\tRatio of the decision\nOn a conjoint reading of the said clauses,it is plain that the appellant was under an obligation to re-deliver the vessel as per the procedure contemplated in the afore-noted clauses\tRatio of the decision\nIndisputably,the vessel in question had not been re-delivered at least during the relevant period and the appellant continued to use the vessel beyond 31st August,1998.Having failed to re-deliver the vessel in terms of Cl.4.1 of the Charter Party,the appellant cannot plead that the Charter Party had been fully worked out\tRatio of the decision\nIt is clear from the pleadings and issue No.2,framed by the Arbitral Tribunal,that it was respondent s consistent stand that since the hired vessel had not been re-delivered at the end of the time charter party,the vessel would be governed by the terms and conditions in the Charter Party dated 6th May,1997\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,the Arbitral Tribunal answered the said issue against the respondent\tRatio of the decision\nIt appears to us that even the question in regard to the effect and consequences of non-delivery of the vessel in terms of the Cl.4.1 and 23 would by itself be a dispute arising under the said Charter Party .With\tRatio of the decision\nrespect\tRatio of the decision\nthe learned Arbitral Tribunal overlooked this aspect of the matter\tRatio of the decision\nWe are,therefore,of the opinion that though performance of the Charter Party agreement dated 6th May,1997 may have come to an end on 31st August,1998\tRuling by Present Court\nbut it was still in existence for some purposes,viz.the effect of vessel s non re-delivery as per the prescribed mechanism and its continued use beyond the stipulated time\tRuling by Present Court\nand,thus,the arbitration clause in the said Charter Party operated in respect of these and other allied purposes\tRuling by Present Court\nTherefore,the factual scenario in the instant case leads to an inescapable conclusion that notwithstanding the expiry of the period fixed in the time charter party dated 6th May,1997,the said charter party did not get extinguished,inter alia,for the purpose of determination of the disputes arising thereunder and the arbitration clause contained therein could be invoked by the respondent\tRuling by Present Court\nIn view of the foregoing discussion,we do not find any infirmity in the view taken by the High Court that Charter Party dated 6th May,1997 had not come to an end by efflux of time and it got extended by the conduct of the parties,warranting interference\tRuling by Present Court\nHaving come to the conclusion that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties,the question which remains to be considered is whether the disputes between the parties should be referred to the same Arbitral Tribunal which had come to the conclusion that in the absence of any arbitration agreement it did not have jurisdiction to entertain and try the claims and counter claims\tRatio of the decision\nWe feel that it would be proper and expedient to constitute a fresh Arbitral Tribunal\tRuling by Present Court\nAccordingly,we constitute an Arbitral Tribunal consisting of Justice M.Jagannadha Rao (Presiding Arbitrator),Justice D.P.Wadhwa and Justice S.N.Variava,former Judges of this Court to adjudicate upon the claim/counter claim by the parties,subject to their consent and such terms and conditions as they may deem fit and proper\tRuling by Present Court\nIt goes without saying that the learned Tribunal shall deal with the matter uninfluenced by any observations in this order on the respective stands of the parties\tRuling by Present Court\nResultantly,the appeal being devoid of any merit is liable to be dismissed,which we do,leaving the parties to bear their own costs\tRatio of the decision\nThe Registry is directed to communicate this order to the learned Members of the Arbitral Tribunal to enable them to enter upon the Reference and decide the matter as expeditiously as practicable\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeal dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"

defendant Nos.1 to 4,respondents herein,for a declaration that the title and format of the suit serial \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" exclusively belonged to them and respondents Nos.1 to 4 have no right thereto and for permanent injunction restraining the said respondents from making use of the title or episodes belonging to the petitioners or any episodes hereafter made\tFacts\nA number of averments germane to this case as set out in the plaint are set out hereunder\tFacts\nThe petitioners carried on business as manufacturers of ayurvedic pharmaceuticals products,which were sold under the brand name of \"Vicco\" and have acquired substantial reputation in the market\tFacts\nThe 1st respondent are an advertising agency and have been the advertising agents in respect of the products manufactured by the petitioners as aforesaid for number of years\tFacts\nThe 2nd respondent is a Director and/or partner of the 1st respondent and has mainly dealt with the petitioners on behalf of the 1st respondent\tFacts\nRespondents Nos.3 & 4 are proprietary concerns of respondent No.2.The 5th respondent is the Union of India and has been joined as the authority concerning Television in India in the name and style of Doordarshan,which is a television media\tFacts\nThe petitioners had employed the respondent Nos.1 to 4 as their advertising agents through the petitioners' sister concern \"M/s Modern Advertising Agency\" and \"Uta Advertising Agency\" and were dealing with the respondent No.1 mainly through the petitioners Managing Director,G.K.Pendharkar\tFacts\nIn 1984,Doordarshan in order to popularize sponsored serial,undertook the production of a serial by the name \"HUMLOG\".The petitioners are also pioneers in making use of Doordarshan for advertising their products through the agency of the 1st respondent,approached the 1st respondent to act as their agents for the purpose of producing a serial which would be shown as petitioners' sponsored programme\tFacts\nThe petitioners agreed to pay the entire costs of the said production to the said advertising agency and requested it to look into the matter,employed various persons on behalf of the petitioners and prepare a suitable serial for them\tFacts\nPursuant to the said arrangement,the respondent Nos.1 to 4 as the agents of the petitioners prepared at the costs and expenses of the petitioners,a serial entitled \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\".The petitioners claimed that as a result of the employment of the respondent Nos.1 to 4 and the finances paid by them the petitioners are the owners of the said serial \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" and the title thereof\tFacts\nThe first and second respondents under the arrangement produced about 60 episodes and the petitioners have spent a crore of rupees for the products and telecast of the said episodes and have also spent large sums of money on advertising to popularize the said programme.\"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" had gained popularity and had become one of the most exclusive and popular serial\tFacts\nThe petitioners claimed that the exclusive right to use the title thereof belonged to them and the 2nd episode of \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" was telecast without the name of the petitioners being mentioned as sponsors nor was their advertisement shown\tFacts\nThis was due to the negligence of the respondent Nos.1 to 4.But the respondents recovered the cost of production from the petitioners\tFacts\nFurther the said respondents had been recovering the cost of production well in advance of the serial episodes being actually produced\tFacts\nThe petitioners claimed that they were the real producers and owners of the said serial \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" and the petitioners to the knowledge of the respondents have entered into an agreement assigning the video rights in the said serial to one M/s Esquire Distributing and Servicing Pvt\tFacts\nLtd.on\tFacts\n01 January 1985.The petitioners though not required to do so,made an ex gratia payment to respondent Nos.1 to 4 of a portion of the royalty received by them from the said M/s Esquire Distributing and Servicing Pvt.Ltd\tFacts\n1st and 2nd respondents had by their letter dated 14 December 1984 confirmed that the petitioners have all T.V.and video rights of the sponsored programme in Hindi \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" and vest with the petitioners\tFacts\nThough original agreement was to have 27 episodes but having regard to the popularity of the programme the petitioners decided to increase the said serial to 52 episodes and by a letter dated 22 April 1985 the petitioners informed respondent Nos.1 and 2 that in the title of the 27th and 28th episodes it has been stated that it is presented by \"Oberoi Films\".Some time in May 1985,the 1st respondent proposed to the petitioners that some other products should be tied up with the serial \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\".However,the petitioners were not interested in the same as they wanted the serial to project their products only exclusively and did not agree to any other products being tied up with the said serial\tFacts\nThe respondents on 27 December 1985 alleged that they were losing Rs.50,000/-to Rs.75,000/-per episode and indicated that they wanted to get a new sponsor\tFacts\nBy their letter dated 02 January 1986 the petitioners informed the 1st and 2nd respondents that it was not possible to increase the costs of production for the episodes and that in the circumstances,the production of the serial may stop\tFacts\nIt was also pointed out that the name \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" is associated with the \"Vicco Laboratories\" and that if they wanted to obtain another sponsor they could produce a new serial under a different name\tFacts\nThe petitioners apprehended that the respondent Nos.1 to 3 intended to produce further episodes under the title \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" making use of the same format as the earlier serial for and on behalf of the third party\tFacts\nThe petitioners reserved their right to sue for damages in terms of Order II,Rule 2 CPC\tFacts\nThe respondent Nos.1 to 4 in their written statement contested the suit\tFacts\nApart from raising the question of valuation of the suit and the pecuniary jurisdiction of the court to try the same they also raised question that the petitioners are not the owners of the copyright in the said serial within the meaning of S.17 of the Copyright Act,1957 and the copyright in respect of the said serial belongs and vests with the respondent Nos.1 to 4\tFacts\nTherefore,it was submitted that the suit lacked cause of action\tArgument\nWhile traversing the case on merit they contended that it was all along agreed between the petitioners and respondents that the copyright in the said serial would rest exclusively in the respondents and not in the petitioners\tArgument\nThus the respondents' name was shown in the title of the said serial as the producer thereof right from the beginning of the said serial but the petitioners did not protest against the same\tArgument\nConsistently with the said intention further,the master cassette of the said serial at all relevant times remained exclusively with the respondents and not with the petitioners and the petitioners paid to the respondents 50% of the royalty received from M/s Esquire Distributing and Servicing Pvt\tArgument\nLtd.under the agreement dated 1 Januray 1985,04 March 1985 and 16 September 1985.The advertisements issued by the petitioners themselves in various newspapers to give wide publicity to the said serial would indicate that the serial mentioned these respondents' are the owners of the copyright in respect of the said serial and the petitioners claim in that behalf is devoid of any substance\tArgument\nThe respondents also contended that even assuming but without admitting that even if the petitioners are the owners of the copyright in respect of the said serial as on the date of the suit they ceased to be such owners in view of the fact that these rights vested in them before the institution of the suit and they have acquiesced in the exercise of the said right by these respondents by their conduct as referred to earlier\tArgument\nIt was also contended that the 2nd respondent is an artist and a film maker and has been in the field of film making for the past 20 years\tArgument\nIn the course of his business the 2nd respondent has developed contacts and connections with important and renowned personalities,artists,technicians etc.in the film industry\tArgument\nIn the year 1967,the 2nd respondent's wife Mrs\tArgument\nSunanda S.Oberoi started the proprietary business of advertising agency in the name and style of Art Commercial and the 2nd respondent used to work in various capacities for the said firm\tArgument\nIn the year 1983,the said proprietary firm was converted into a private limited company which is the 1st respondent in the present suit and the 2nd respondent constituted respondent Nos.3 and 4 as his proprietary firm\tArgument\nAbout 18 years ago before filing of the suit,the respondents came into contact with the petitioners initially as clients in connection with the job of advertisement of their products on All India Radio,theatre and films and later,on television\tArgument\nThese ad-films and jingles fetched handsome returns for the petitioners and boosted their sales beyond their own expectations\tFacts\nIn course of time,the 2nd respondent and partners of the petitioners especially G.K.Pendharkar came very close to each other and developed very intimate relations\tFacts\nEither at the end of 1983 or early part of 1984,the 5th respondent through the said Doorsarshan decided to introduce the production of films or serials especially for exhibitions on TV instead of exhibiting/telecasting films produced by the professional film producers on payment of exorbitant royalty to them,partly as an economy measure and partly to provide avenues to and exposure new talents\tFacts\nThe 5th respondent thereafter decided to entertain/welcome and/or encourage the proposals from the private producers to produce such serials or films at their own cost and responsibility and under the said scheme the advertisers desirous of linking up their advertisements with such films or serials were required to negotiate and settle directly with the producers of such films and/or serials,the royalty or consideration payable to such producers for linking up their advertisements and commercials with their film/serial and under the said scheme further,such advertisements were offered handsome concessions in the rates of advertisements for display of their ads on TV\tFacts\nAs against the regular rates/charge of Rs.3,24,000/-for display of advertisements on TV of such advertisers for 120 seconds per telecast,the relevant time,at the rate of Rs.35,000/-only for 120 seconds in addition to the royalty or consideration payable to the producers of such films or serials which invariably was far less than the difference between the usual rates and concession rates of advertisements\tFacts\nThe 2nd respondent undertook the preliminary project work on his own without loss of any time\tFacts\nThe 2nd respondent made extensive study and research and prepared a format of the proposed serial\tFacts\nThe said team of the 2nd respondent responded to his appeal and took great pains and put in hard work in the said project and presented to him an exclusive and ingenious format of the proposed serial\tFacts\nThe 2nd respondent then approached the 5th respondent through Doordarshan with his proposal to produce the said serial then proposed to be entitled \"Mussibat Hai\".After a number of meetings between the 2nd respondent and the concerned officers and the authorities of the respondents at Delhi in connection with the said proposal approved a pilot [i.e.the first episode as sample] on 19 September 1984 to produce a TV serial comprising 52 episodes subject of course to the 5th respondent discretion to discontinue the same if the same proved a flop before the expiry of the stipulated period\tFacts\nThe entire cost of the spade work and the cost of the title song was borne exclusively by the respondents and nothing was contributed by the petitioners in this regard\tFacts\nThe 5th respondent registered the respondent Nos.1 and 2 as the producers of the said serial\tFacts\nAfter finalizing the proposal by the TV authorities,respondent No.2 asked the petitioners as to whether they were interested in the linking up their ads with the said serial\tFacts\nPetitioners agreed to link up their ads with 26 episodes of the said serial\tFacts\nThe petitioners agreed to pay fixed amount to these respondents per episode for linking up their commercials with the said serial and not on the basis of the actual cost of production of each episode so that if the cost of production exceeded the said fixed amount the respondents had to bear the same\tFacts\nIn these circumstances,the respondents contended that by entering into the said agreement of sponsorship,neither the petitioners nor the respondents created nor did they ever intend to create any relationship of employer and employee and/or master and servant or principal and agent between the petitioners on the one hand and the respondents No.1 to 4 on the other\tFacts\nNor did the parties intend that the respondents should produce the said serial for the petitioners or at the instance of the petitioners and the respondents intended to embark on the production of the said serial on their own\tFacts\nThe petitioners by their letter dated 02 January 1987 turned down the respondents' demand and informed the respondents that they had no objection if the respondents went ahead with the production of the said serial and merely requested the respondents that the title of the said serial \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" may not be used by the respondents\tArgument\nIn the meanwhile,the respondents contended that M/s Brook Bond Ltd.who wanted to link up their commercial with 13 episodes and agreed to pay and paid the ruling market price\tArgument\nOn these grounds,the respondents contended that the suit of the petitioners is misconceived,malicious and baseless and is liable to be dismissed\tArgument\nThe respondents contended that on no occasion the petitioners acted as a producer and even the contract was signed by the petitioners as an Advertiser and by the respondent No.1 as an approved agent\tArgument\nThe respondents strongly contended that the serial \"Hum Log\" was produced by the petitioners in collaboration with M/s Concept Advertisers\tArgument\nThe trial court raised as many as 12 issues and they are as follows: \"1.\"Is it proved that this Court has no pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain and try this suit\tFacts\n2.Do\tFacts\nthe plaintiffs prove that the T.V.serial entitled \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" was produced by the defendant Nos.1 to 4 as agents and (the said serial made by defendant Nos.1 to 4) in the course of their employment with the plaintiffs as alleged\tFacts\n3.Do the plaintiffs prove that the entire serial rights including the excluding the exclusive right to use the title thereof,belong to the plaintiffs as alleged\tFacts\n4.Are defendant Nos.1 to 4 entitled to deny the ownership of the plaintiffs of the Film\tFacts\nYeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" in view of Exhibits a,B and E (colly) to the plaint\tFacts\n5.Do\tFacts\nthe defendants prove that the plaintiffs are not the owners of the copyright of the TV serial/film,viz.,\"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" ,within the meaning of S.17 of the Copyright Act\tFacts\n6.Do\tFacts\nthe defendant Nos.1 to 4 prove that it was intended between the parties that copyrights in respect of the said film should vest exclusively with the defendants or that the right of ownership was waived by the plaintiffs\tFacts\n7.Does\tFacts\nthe suit suffer from non-joinder of necessary parties\tFacts\n8.Is\tFacts\nthe suit not maintainable against defendant No.5 for failure to give notice u/s 80 of CPC\tFacts\n9.Are\tFacts\nthe plaintiffs entitled to the declaration sought\tFacts\n10.Are\tFacts\nthe plaintiffs entitled to permanent injuction as prayed for\tFacts\n11.To what relief,if any,are the plaintiffs entitled\tFacts\n12.What order\tFacts\nThe trial court found that the petitioners have not been able to prove that the TV serial \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" was produced by defendants Nos.1 to 4 as agents in the course of their employment as the agent of the petitioners as contended in the suit\tFacts\nThe petitioners were also not able to prove that the entire serial rights including the exclusive right to use the title thereof belonged to the petitioners as alleged\tFacts\nIt was also held that the respondents Nos.1 to 4 are entitled to deny the ownership of the petitioners of the film \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi in view of Exhibits A,B and E produced in the case\tFacts\nIt was also held that the respondents proved that the petitioners are not the owners of the copy right of the TV serial/film viz.,\"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" within the meaning of S.17 of the Copy Right Act and it was intended between the parties that copy rights in respect of the said film should vest exclusively with the respondents or that the rights of ownership was waived by the petitioners\tFacts\nAfter examining the oral and documentary evidence on record it is disclosed that prior to letter sent on 11 July 1984 the petitioners were acquainted even with the format of the suit serial,they did not have any connection with the suit serial till that date and relied upon the wording used therein to the effect that \"you and Mr\tFacts\nG.K.Pendharkar are requested to join Mr\tFacts\nOberoi and his creative team when the format of the proposed half and hour sponsored programme shall be presented to you\tFacts\nThat was the first occasion when the format was presented to the petitioners\tFacts\nIt was also on record that the Shri G.K.Pendharkar of the petitioners and respondent No.2 had long standing relations with each other and they had already done a lot of advertising works for the petitioners before the production of the suit serial\tFacts\nExhibit G-1 (which is Exhibit 27-A in the petitioners' compilation) is a letter written by Shri S.P.Agrawal,Controller of Programmes of Doordarshan to respondent No.1,M/s Art Commercia with reference to the format for the proposed serial of half and hour duration tentatively titled \"Musibat Hai\" serial sent to them on 13 July 1984.Since the letter was addressed to M/s Art Commercia in which the proposal was accepted for production of the serial and the first episode was to be sent for preview and approval which would be given only after seeing the recording of the first episode\tFacts\nThat letter had been addressed to respondent No.1,M/s Art Commercia\tFacts\nThe trial court felt that it was addressed not to the petitioners but to the respondents alone\tFacts\nThe trial court also relied on Exhibit C-1 which indicated that the respondents were submitting a format for the serial which was to be registered on behalf of the client M/s Vicco Laboratories\tFacts\nThe learned Judge of the trial court took the view that this letter nowhere mentioned that the respondents wanted to register their format on behalf of their producers which is consistent with the modern norms of advertising\tFacts\nThe trial court ultimately came to the conclusion that the spade work on the production of the suit serial had already started before 11 July 1984 and on that day for the first time film was presented to the petitioners\tFacts\nIt was,therefore,found that there was no copy right attached to any idea,but copy right is attached to the work and what is important is that not only the idea of producing the suit serial on TV came to the mind of respondent No.2 but he had already started working on it in advance and forwarded it to Doordarshan for its approval\tRatio of the decision\nThe trial court,after examining Exhibits C-1,E-1,F-1 P-1 found that the proposal was for 52 episodes and was accepted by the Doordarshan,while the case put forth on behalf of the appellants is that the original agreement was to have 27 episodes and having regard to the popularity of the programme the petitioners decided to increase the said serial to 52 episodes\tFacts\nThe evidence was found to be inconsistent with the theory put forth by the petitioners that they are producers of the suit serial and,if it were to hold otherwise,the agreement or arrangement with the respondents was only for 26 episodes,whereas the sponsorship was for 52 episodes\tFacts\nThe trial court examined in detail the letter dated 19 July 1984 (Exhibit F-1) written by Shri G.K.Pendharkar of the petitioners and concluded that averments made in the plaint stated that the original agreement was to have 27 episodes but having regard to the popularity of the serial programme the petitioners decided to increase the said serial to 52 episodes\tFacts\nIn one of the contracts (Exhibit H-1) the wording used is as under :- \"Sponsorship of programme of 25 mts duration produced by sponsor entitled \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" including 2 mts free commercial time\tFacts\nRelying upon this letter emphasis was laid on the words \"produced by sponsors\" .Whether two capacities \"sponsor\" and \"producer\" can co-exist in one and the same person or not has been examined and the trial court noted that the wording had been borrowed from the Tariff Card and Tariff Card also indicated what are the categories of the advertisers and rates thereof\tFacts\nIt is held that words \"produced by sponsors\" would not mean that the sponsors themselves are the producers of the said programmes,as is clear from the Tariff Card\tFacts\nThe trial court proceeded thereafter to examine the payments made in regard to production of the serial\tFacts\nThus it was found that the first 26 episodes the amount per episode paid by the petitioners was Rs.1,20,000/-and each bill contained the expression \"service charges\" which was stated by the appellants that the respondents acted as agents of the petitioners for production of suit serial\tFacts\nOn proper construction of the bills the trial court rejected the contention that these bills and payments as showing that they had borne the costs of production of the suit serial and,therefore,they are the producers\tFacts\nInasmuch as the respondents could not claim any amount at random,details regarding expenditure were included in the bills and therefore it is the sponsor's price for sponsoring the suit serial\tFacts\nStrong reliance was placed upon certain circumstances,namely,that the format had been approved by the petitioners only on 11 July 1984 and PW-1 admitted that in view of the bill the entry claiming deduction made by the petitioners in their accounts in the financial year ending on 30 March 1984; that the amount was not to be paid for all 26 episodes or even thereafter in lump sum and the bill for 26 episodes enabled petitioners to claim deduction for the entire amount without actual payment in financial year 1983-84; that the entry made for the financial year 1983-84 was beneficial to the petitioners that there was no ceiling on advertising expenditure and it was introduced from 1 April 1984 onwards,the plaintiff did not produce the account books to show if the deduction in respect of the entire amount was claimed or not though they were repeatedly called upon to produce them\tFacts\nThe trial court was conscious enough not to enter into the controversy whether during the particular account year ending on 31 March 1984 the advertising expenditure was fully exempted from tax or that there was disallowance of 20 per cent on that point and the decision regarding income tax deductions is not necessary as there is enough other material to show that the said bill was ante-date\tFacts\nThe change in the title from 55th episode \"for Vicco Laboratories\" was introduced\tFacts\nTheir contention was that there was a protest from the petitioners and as a result thereof this change took place\tFacts\nThe 55th episode was telecast sometime at the end of November or beginning of December 1985 and thus there was a time gap of 7/8 months between the protest and the telecast of the 55th episode\tFacts\nTherefore,it cannot be said that there is any communication between the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe trial court also noticed that in respect of both the advertisements and also in respect of suit serial the petitioners paid to the respondent Nos.5 and 6 amount which was to be the maximum amount\tFacts\nThus the profits or loss was of the respondents and there is element of liability to render account was missing and thus there was no question of respondents being the agents of the petitioners within the meaning of S.182 of the Indian Contract Act\tFacts\nThe suit serial was produced by the respondents as agents of the petitioners was false\tFacts\nThe facts emerging in the case indicate that the petitioners had joined the production of the suit serial after some concrete beginning had been made like recording of the title song,the conceiving of the title and format of the suit serial,etc\tFacts\nThe trial court summed up the position that the two capacities \"sponsor\" and \"producer\" cannot co-exist in one and the same person\tFacts\nIf the documents are interpreted that the petitioners are the sponsors as well as the producers it would lead to absurd results\tFacts\nThus the trial court proceeded to uphold the contentions raised on behalf of the respondents to dismiss the suit\tFacts\nOn appeal,the High Court re-examined the matter and on examination of the pleadings,the contentions,put forth before the court,the evidence on record and the findings recorded by the trial court,concluded that the findings recorded by the trial court are proper\tFacts\nIn doing so,the High Court noticed that the admitted position in the pleadings and the oral evidence is that the petitioners agreed to sponsor only 26 episodes whereas the respondents had agreed to produce 52 episodes and had made firm commitment to Doordarshan to that effect and this circumstance militates against the respondents having undertaken the production at the behest or at the request of the petitioners\tFacts\nThe High Court observed that the petitioners had no knowledge of the Doordarshan scheme regarding the sponsored programme and linking of 2 minutes advertisement and agreed with the findings of the trial court that it is improbable for the respondents to have agreed to reduce its income in the form of commission and undertake the responsible job of production of the serial\tRuling by Lower Court\nIt was stated that certain bills had been given to the petitioners to suit their convenience in tax matters and there was no such bill submitted to the petitioners by the respondents when the petitioner had agreed to extend the sponsorship from episodes Nos.27 to 52 and noticed the nature of the system of accounting maintained by them and held that the petitioners had got deductions in respect of the entire amount of the bill in the year which ended on 31 March 1984\tRuling by Lower Court\nThe High Court also noticed the circumstance of respondent No.2's name appearing as 'producer' in the titles of the suit serial and the petitioners did not do anything by way of protest or other objection or take steps to withhold payment of the respondents which in the normal course would have been done and,therefore,the explanation now sought to be offered by the petitioners in the form of a written protest was devoid of any substance\tFacts\nThe explanation given by the petitioners that they were busy in the shootings did not carry much weight with the High Court\tFacts\nThe High Court also examined the scope of S.17 of the Copyright Act and the ingredients thereof not having been established the High Court held that no claim could be based on the same and thus agreed with the findings recorded by the trial court and dismissed the appeal\tFacts\nIn this special leave petition u/art.136 of the Constitution,the contentions raised before the High Court are reiterated particularly as to the effect of S.17 of the Copyright Act and whether the correspondence on record would not indicate that they were entitled to ownership and copyright in respect of the TV programme 'Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel for the petitioners strongly relied upon the following documents: \"1.The cost estimate\tArgument\n2.The bills of cost of production\tArgument\n3.Letters dated 14 December 1984 and 15 November 1985\tArgument\n4.Contracts with Doordarshan\tArgument\n5.Contractd with Esquire Distributing & Servicing Pvt.Ltd\tArgument\nWe have carefully considered the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioners\tRatio of the decision\nWe are not satisfied that the petitioners have made out a case for consideration by this Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe matter rests purely upon the appreciation of evidence on record and does not give rise to any question of such importance as to be decided by this Court u/art.136 of the Constitution\tRatio of the decision\nIt is clear from the findings recorded by the trial court and the appellate court: \"1.That the respondents have not undertaken the production of the said serial at the instance of the petitioners\tRatio of the decision\nG.K.Pendharkar,the Managing Director of petitioner No.1 was asked to come to view the format of the programme and the petitioners were not even acquainted with the format of the serial while the respondents had taken concrete steps in this regard prior to the letter dated 11 July 1984\tRatio of the decision\n2.That the petitioners had agreed to sponsor only 26 episodes whereas the respondents had agreed to produce 52 episodes and had given a firm commitment to that effect to Doordarshan as is clear from the letter dated 12 July 1984 sent by the respondents to Doordarshan\tRatio of the decision\nThe trial court thus rightly noted that there was no agency between the parties\tRatio of the decision\n3.That the titles of each episode indicated that respondent No.2 is the producer of the said serial and the petitioners are only the sponsors\tRatio of the decision\nAs late as on 22 April 1985,the petitioners communicated their displeasure on this display in the episodes as to the titles\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,the titles continued to show Mr\tRatio of the decision\nS.S.Oberoi as the producer of the serial and the petitioners did not withhold payments\tRatio of the decision\n4.That the courts below have refuted the claim of the petitioners that the bill dated 19 March 1984 establishes the fact that the production work had been started by the respondents at the behest of the petitioners\tRatio of the decision\nIt has been proved that the said bill was ante-dated and raised by the respondents in July,1984 ostensibly for the purpose of benefiting the petitioners for their obtaining tax concessions\tRatio of the decision\n5.That the Doordarshan,which have been impleaded as a party,in their written statement stated that they recognize the respondents as producers of the said serial and recognize the petitioners as sponsors only\tRatio of the decision\n6.That the evidence of Mr\tRatio of the decision\nS.S.Gill,who gave evidence on behalf of the Information & Broadcasting Ministry that he was not acquainted with Mr\tRatio of the decision\nPendharkar and that Doordarshan had no direct connection with the petitioners but only with the respondents as producers or the Director stood un-impeached\tRatio of the decision\nIn his further evidence,Mr\tRatio of the decision\nGill stated that some time in the month of May/June,1984 he had met Kundan Shah and requested to make a comedy serial for Doordarshan which clearly indicated that it is only the respondents who were dealing with Doordarshan\tRatio of the decision\n7.That the video rights were assigned to Esquire Distributing & Servicing Pvt\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.by the respondents pursuant to letters dated 14 December 1984 and 15 November 1985 and had received royalty for the video rights and the original U-matic cassettes were returned to them by Esquire Distributing & Servicing Pvt\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.as their property\tRatio of the decision\n8.That there was no transfer of rights in favour of the petitioners by the respondents in the aforesaid letters and no consideration whatsoever was paid to the respondents for issuing the said letters which have no legal consequences and it was after the petitioners received the letter dated 19 October 1985 from Esquire Distributing & Servicing Pvt\tRatio of the decision\nLtd.that the respondents were asked by the petitioners to issue another letter in this regard\tRatio of the decision\nThus the pleadings and the evidence on record clearly indicated that the respondents were not the agents of the petitioners for the purpose of producing the said serial\tRatio of the decision\nThe aggregate amount of Rs.76.50 lakhs which was paid to the respondents for 60 episodes is not the amount for cost of production but the fixed price for sponsoring the said serial in order to link up their advertisement with the serial and avail substantial benefit of concessional rate under the scheme envisaged by Doordarshan\tRatio of the decision\nThe respondents were not liable to render accounts to the petitioners who paid them a fixed sum for sponsoring the programme\tRatio of the decision\nIf the expenses were less,the petitioners did not ask for a refund and the profit or loss was entirely of the respondents\tRatio of the decision\nIt is clear that the bills that have been raised were only to accommodate the petitioners from the circumstances narrated above\tRatio of the decision\nHowever,the learned counsel for the petitioners made elaborate reference to the Income Tax Act,1961 and the provisions whether such availment of benefit could be taken or not pursuant to the amendment effected to the provisions relating to computation of business income at different stages may not be very germane to the present case\tRatio of the decision\nIt is probable that the respondents had obliged the petitioners by issuing these bills because the bills cannot be read in isolation but with reference to surrounding circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore,the view taken by the courts below in this regard appears to be correct\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as the contentions raised on the basis of S.17 of the Copyright Act is concerned,it is clear that the petitioners were not able to establish that the respondent Nos.1 to 4 produced the said serial (1) as the agents of the petitioners; (2) in the course of their employment with the petitioners; (3) for valuable consideration paid by the petitioners to them; and (iv) at the instance of the petitioners\tRatio of the decision\nWhen these factors had not been established and the suit is itself not dependent on the interpretation of S.17 of the Copyright Act,pleadings and issues raised did not attract the same\tRatio of the decision\nOn appreciation of evidence,the courts below have come to the conclusion that the respondents did not make the said serial for valuable consideration at the instance of the petitioners and in view of the findings of fact,the claim of copyright or ownership in respect of the serial u/s.17(b) and (c) would not arise at all\tRatio of the decision\nThus we find absolutely no merit in this petition\tRuling by Present Court\nWe decline to interfere with the order made by the High Court affirming the decree of the trial court\tRuling by Present Court\nPetition dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"
