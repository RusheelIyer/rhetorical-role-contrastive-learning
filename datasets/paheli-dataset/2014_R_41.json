was carrying fetus of two months\tFacts\nThe sole eyewitness was a boy of 13 years of age -Anil Kumar (PW-21),who worked as a servant with the family\tFacts\nShashi Tripathi had brought him home from Bilaspur\tFacts\nHe participated in the identification parade,which was held in Sub Jail,Bemetara,and identified the accused persons in the court by touching them\tFacts\nWe have carefully examined the manner in which the identification parade was conducted and the manner in which the boy -Anil Kumar (PW-21) identified the accused in Court and we have no reason to doubt the identification of the accused,which assumes importance in this case since the boy did not know the accused before the incident\tRatio of the decision\nIt is Anil Kumar (PW -21),who first informed the head of the family Dr\tFacts\nSharda Prasad Tripathi (PW-1),the complainant,about the incident,when he came home after closing his clinic\tFacts\nHe deposed before the Court that Shashi Didi (accused) brought him to village -Jevra from Bilaspur\tFacts\nHe lived in the house of Shashi Didi\tFacts\nHe ate his food there and studied in a school\tFacts\nHe deposed that Doctor Sahab is her husband and Shivendra and Jitendra are her sons\tFacts\nJitendra is her step-son and the deceased Bhavna is the wife of Jitendra\tFacts\nShe resided with Shashi Didi\tFacts\nJitendra is a doctor,resided and practiced at Khamaria,whereas his wife resided at Jevra\tFacts\nHis brother -Shivendra studies at Calcutta\tFacts\nHe referred to Bhavna as Bhabhi\tFacts\nHe stated that Shashi Didi and Bhavna sometimes used to quarrel\tFacts\nAbout the assault,he deposed that Devendra caught Bhavna and Chandra Prakash attacked her with knife 3 to 4 times and she fell down\tFacts\nThe incident occurred in the courtyard and Shashi Didi was present in the passage\tFacts\nMahesh,the fourth accused,was standing outside the house\tFacts\nAfter the assault,Chandra Prakash went to the TV room where Shashi Didi had kept some money in a rubber band on the table\tFacts\nThe accused -Chandra Prakash had threatened him not to disclose anything about the incident to anyone\tFacts\nThereafter all the three accused fled from there\tFacts\nHe further deposed that Shashi Didi took him upstairs to the terrace and asked him not to disclose the truth to anyone but to say that thieves came into the house and committed the crime\tFacts\nShashi Didi thereafter started shouting\tFacts\nThen she lay down on the courtyard near Bhavna Bhabhi\tFacts\nThis deposition clearly implicates accused Nos.1,2 and 4.The picture that emerges is that Shashi Tripathi caused Bhavna to be killed and for this purpose engaged Chandra Prakash (accused No.2) and Raju\tRatio of the decision\nDevendra Choubey (accused No.4) by paying them money\tRatio of the decision\nShe also seems to have had a scuffle with Bhavna,which is apparent from the fact that her hair was found in the grip of the deceased during investigation\tRatio of the decision\nIt is obvious that accused nos.2 and 4 did not enter the house to commit a robbery and had a single mission,namely,to kill Bhavana\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence that they had any previous animosity with the deceased and appeared to have acted as contract killers\tRatio of the decision\nThe prosecution has found it difficult to pinpoint the motive but Shashi Tripathi's husband Dr\tRatio of the decision\nSharda Prasad Tripathi (PW-1) deposed before the Court that she tried to create a hindrance in the marriage of his son Jitendra since she wanted her daughter Abhilasha to marry him; however,he went ahead with the marriage of Jitendra to Bhavna,whereupon Shashi Tripathi remained silent\tRatio of the decision\nThe credibility of the evidence of Anil Kumar (PW-21) was attacked by the learned counsel for the appellants,who submitted that the boy is a tutored witness,who has been influenced by the police with whom he spent a lot of time\tArgument\nIn fact,he even came to the Court in the company of a police constable after being served summons at Allahabad\tArgument\nThe learned counsel submitted that the evidence of a child witness must be carefully scrutinized before acceptance since a child can be easy prey for tutoring and the court must insist on corroboration from other evidence\tArgument\nOn a careful perusal of the deposition of this child witness,we have not found any reason why he would have lied\tRatio of the decision\nHe was brought to the house by Shashi Tripathi (accused),who apparently took care of him and sent to school and gave him food and residence\tRatio of the decision\nHe had no grouse against her neither any ulterior motive in identifying the accused,who were not acquainted to him\tRatio of the decision\nThere was no reason for the sole eye witness -Anil (PW-21) to implicate anybody falsely\tRatio of the decision\nMerely because he has been some time in the company of the police at the police station his testimony cannot be discarded as untrue\tRatio of the decision\nThe incident occurred within the four walls of the house of the accused -Shashi Tripathi and the only witness was the boy -Anil\tRatio of the decision\nPW-21).His statement that the accused Chandra Prakash attacked the deceased is corroborated by the recovery of knife from Chandra Prakash\tRatio of the decision\nIt must be remembered that the boy comes from a rural back ground and was 13 years of age when the incident occurred\tRatio of the decision\nHis presence in the house is entirely natural and we have no reason to discard his testimony\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel for the appellants forcefully attacked the conviction of the other accused viz\tArgument\nMahesh,Chandra Prakash and Devendra Kumar,who admittedly were not known to the child witness Anil Kumar\tArgument\nIt was submitted that the test identification parade were delayed and the identification of these accused by the witness in Court was not reliable\tArgument\nIt is not possible for us to accept this contention\tRatio of the decision\nMahesh and Chandra Prakash were arrested on 29.11.2003,their identification parade was conducted on 13.12.2003 -(within a fortnight or so\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused Devendra Kumar was arrested on 22.12.2003 and his identification parade was conducted on 26.12.2003-(within four days).There is no evidence on record to show that the child witness had an opportunity to see and study the features of the accused between their arrest and test identification parade to enable a tutored identification\tRatio of the decision\nIn any case,the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay\tRatio of the decision\nThe learned counsel for the appellants relied upon the Judgment of this Court in Budhsen and Anr\tPrecedent\nVs\tPrecedent\nState of U.P.(1970) 2 SCC 128 1970 Indlaw SC 136 where this Court made the following observations:- \"7.Now,facts which establish the identity of an accused person are relevant u/s.9 of the Indian Evidence Act\tPrecedent\nAs a general rule,the substantive evidence of a witness is a statement made in court\tPrecedent\nThe evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character\tPrecedent\nThe evidence in order to carry conviction should ordinarily clarify as to how and under what circumstances he came to pick out the particular accused person and the details of the part which the accused played in the crime in question with reasonable particularity\tPrecedent\nThe purpose of a prior test identification,therefore,seems to be to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence\tPrecedent\nIt is accordingly considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding\tPrecedent\nThere may,however,be exceptions to this general rule,when for example,the court is impressed by a particular witness,on whose testimony it can safely rely,without such or other corroboration\tPrecedent\nThe identification parades belong to the investigation stage\tPrecedent\nThey are generally held during the course of investigation with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence,who were not previously known to them\tPrecedent\nThis serves to satisfy the investigating officers of the bona fides of the prosecution witnesses and also to furnish evidence to corroborate their testimony in court\tPrecedent\nIdentification proceedings in their legal effect amount simply to this: that certain persons are brought to jail or some other place and make statements either express or implied that certain individuals whom they point out are persons whom they recognise as having been concerned in the crime\tPrecedent\nThey do not constitute substantive evidence\tPrecedent\nThese parades are of the essentially governed by Section 162,Criminal Procedure Code\tPrecedent\nIt is for this reason that the identification parades in this case seem to have been held under the supervision of a Magistrate\tPrecedent\nKeeping in view the purpose of identification parades the Magistrates holding them are expected to take all possible precautions to eliminate any suspicion of unfairness and to reduce the chance of testimonial error\tPrecedent\nThey must,therefore,take intelligent interest in the proceedings,bearing in mind two considerations: (i) that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution and (ii) that justice should be done in the identification\tPrecedent\nThose proceeding should not make it impossible for the identifiers who,after all,have,as a rule,only fleeting glimpses of the person they are supposed to identify\tPrecedent\nGenerally speaking,the Magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused,so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence\tPrecedent\nThe power to identify,it may be kept in view,varies according to the power of observation and memory of the person identifying and each case depends on its own facts,but there are two factors which seem to be of basic importance in the evaluation of identification\tPrecedent\nThe persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of the crime and before identification and secondly that no mistakes are made by them or the mistakes made are negligible\tPrecedent\nThe identification to be of value should also be held without much delay\tPrecedent\nThe number of persons mixed up with the accused should be reasonably large and their bearing and general appearance not glaringly dissimilar\tPrecedent\nThe evidence as to identification deserves,therefore,to be subjected to a close and careful scrutiny by the Court\tPrecedent\nThe observations of this Court undoubtedly lay down the correct law and we have no reason to doubt them\tRatio of the decision\nWe,however,do not see how the observations help the appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIn the present case,the child witness has been found to be reliable\tRatio of the decision\nHis presence is not doubted,since he resided with the family for whom he worked\tRatio of the decision\nHe had no axe to grind against any of the accused\tRatio of the decision\nHe became the unfortunate witness of a gruesome murder and fearlessly identified the accused in Court\tRatio of the decision\nIn his deposition he specified the details of the part which the accused played with reasonable particularity\tRatio of the decision\nIn such a situation,it is considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witness in Court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them,in the form of earlier identification proceeding,as observed by this Court in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court has not laid down the requirement in general that all identification parades must be under the supervision of a Magistrate as in Budhsen's case 1970 Indlaw SC 136 (supra).The learned counsel for the appellants also relied upon the Judgments of this Court in Subash and Shiv Kumar Vs\tRatio of the decision\nState of U.P.(1987) 3 SCC 331 1987 Indlaw SC 28887,and Mohd\tRatio of the decision\nAbdul Hafeez Vs\tRatio of the decision\nState of Andhra Pradesh AIR 1983\tRatio of the decision\nSC 367 1982 Indlaw SC 63.The facts and circumstances of the cases are however different and it is not necessary to consider those cases in detail while dealing with the present case\tRatio of the decision\nSuffice it to say that those cases do not create any doubt as regards the conviction in this case\tRatio of the decision\nMr\tArgument\nP.C.Agrawala,learned senior counsel for the appellant Mahesh (accused no.3),vehemently submitted that this accused ought not to have been convicted u/s.302 with the aid of Ss.34 and 120 (B) of IPC.In particular it was submitted that the role attributed to the accused was that he merely stood outside the house\tArgument\nHe did not even act as a guard because when the witness Anil Kumar (PW-21) came to the house,he was not even stopped by the accused from entering the house\tArgument\nThe learned counsel for Mahesh (accused no.3) relied on several decisions of this Court in Suresh Sakharam Nangare Vs\tArgument\nState of Maharashtra (2012) 9 SCC 249 2012 Indlaw SC 304,Jai Bhagwan Vs\tArgument\nState of Haryana AIR 1999 SC 1083 1999 Indlaw SC 391 and Ramashish Yadav Vs\tArgument\nState of Bihar (1999) 8 SCC 555 1999 Indlaw SC 693\tArgument\nIt is settled law that common intention and conspiracy are matters of inference and if while drawing an inference any benefit of doubt creeps in,it must go to the accused vide Baliya Vs\tRatio of the decision\nState of M.P.(2012\tRatio of the decision\n9 SCC 696 2012 Indlaw SC 343\tRatio of the decision\nOn a careful conspectus of the facts and the law,we are of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of Mahesh beyond reasonable doubt\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime\tRatio of the decision\nHe was merely seen by the witness as standing outside the house when the witness came home\tRatio of the decision\nMahesh did not even act as a guard; he did not prevent Anil Kumar (PW-21) from entering the house\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no reference to a third person in the FIR; no evidence that he came with the other accused or left with them\tRatio of the decision\nNo weapon was seized from him,nor was any property connected with the crime,seized\tRatio of the decision\nHaving regard to the role attributed to him and the absence of incriminating factors we find that it is not safe to convict Mahesh of the offence of murder with the aid of Ss.34 and 120(B\tRatio of the decision\nWe therefore,hold that the accused Mahesh (accused no.3) in Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2013 is innocent and the conviction against him is set aside\tRuling by Present Court\nHis bail bonds stand cancelled and sureties are discharged\tRuling by Present Court\nIn view of the above,Criminal Appeal No.867 of 2013 is allowed and Criminal Appeal Nos.822 of 2012,589 of 2014 and Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.3737 of 2014 are dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals disposed of\tRuling by Present Court\n"}}
