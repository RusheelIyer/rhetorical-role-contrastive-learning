State of West Bengal, [1994] 2 SCC 220 1994 Indlaw SC 1743, (wherein one of us, Dr. A.S. Anand, J., as His Lordship then was, spoke for the Bench\tPrecedent\nthis Court held as under : \"In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn have not only to be fully established but also that all the circumstances so established should be of a conclusive nature and consistent only with the hypoth-esis of the guilt of the accused\tPrecedent\nThose circumstances should not be capable of being explained by any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused and the chain of the evidence must be so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the belief consistent with the innocence of the accused\tPrecedent\nIt needs no reminder that legally estab-lished circumstances and not merely indignation of the court can form the basis of conviction and the more serious the crime, the greater should be the care taken to scrutinize the evidence lest suspicion takes the place of proof\tPrecedent\nIn Dhananjoy Chatterjee's case 1994 Indlaw SC 1743 (supra), the decision of this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, [1984] 4 SCC 116 1984 Indlaw SC 432, was relied on\tPrecedent\nIn the later case, it was also held that a false explanation or false plea taken by the accused can be used as an additional link in the chain of circumstantial evidence subject to satisfication of three essential conditions, namely (i) various links in the chain of evidence led by the prosecution have been satisfactorily proved, (ii) the said circumstance points to the guilt of the accused with reasonable definiteness, and (iii) the circumstance is in proxim-ity to the time and situation\tPrecedent\ni\tPrecedent\nLast seen together : On the point of last seen together there is solitary testimony of a child witness Shalu, PW7, aged about 4 years on 23.3.1992, the date of her examination in the court\tPrecedent\nOn asking a few questions by way of preliminary examination the learned Trial Judge found that the witness could 'answer some of the questions\tPrecedent\nShe stated that, accompanied by Phukla-another young girl, a cousin of hers, and S the deceased, she had gone to purchase balloon from the shop of Goma\tPrecedent\nWhile returning the accused told S that her feet were mudstained and he would wash her feet and saying so he took S inside his house, leaving behind the two girls, including Shalu PW7, who returned to their houses leaving S behind\tPrecedent\nIt is this testimony which has been relied upon by the Trial Court as also by the High Court as the evidence of 'last seen together\tRatio of the decision\nThe witness is a child witness of very tender age and examined in the Court almost a year after the date of the incident\tRatio of the decision\nWe have very carefully read the statement of this witness\tRatio of the decision\nThere is nothing in her statement to suggest that what she is narrating in the court is the story of a day soon before the date and time of the incident or the date on which dead body of S was found\tRatio of the decision\nTo constitute evidence of last seen together, the evidence must definitely permit an inference being drawn that the victim and the accused were seen together at a point of time in close proximity with the time and date of the commission of crime\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the evi-dence of Shalu, PW7 such an inference cannot be drawn\tRatio of the decision\nGoma, to whose shop the three girls had gone to buy balloon, has not been examined\tRatio of the decision\nThere is something mysterious about the discovery of Shalu as a witness to the incident\tRatio of the decision\nS has died\tRatio of the decision\nThe third girl who was with S and Shalu has not been examined either in the Court or during investigation\tRatio of the decision\nThe statement of Shahu was recorded during investigation on 25.3.1991, i.e. about six days after the date of incident\tRatio of the decision\nHarish Chand Sharma, the Investigating Officer, was specifically asked how the name of this witness came to his knowledge during investigation\tRatio of the decision\nHe gave an evasive answer saying that the fact that Shalu was accompanying S 'must have come in the staement of the witnesses\tRatio of the decision\nHe was further asked to name the witness in whose statement Shalu's reference was available but the investigation officer drew a blank and could not tell the name of the witness from whom any clue as to Shalu was received by him\tRatio of the decision\nThus how and in what manner the investigating officer came to learn about Shalu, PW7 so as to record her statement during investigation remains shrounded in mystery\tRatio of the decision\nThe fact remains that the testimony of Shalu, PW 7 aged 4 years, even if taken at its face value, does not constitute such a circumstance as to draw an incriminating inference against the accused and connect him with the crime\tRatio of the decision\nii\tRatio of the decision\nAbnormal conduct of accused Kalu Ram, PW5 stated that two or three days after the date of dead body of S having been found\tRatio of the decision\nhe and Santosh\tRatio of the decision\nPW9 had gone to see a movie in a cinema hall where the accused was employed as a gate-keeper\tRatio of the decision\nThere the accused had enquired from them as to what was the punishment awardable to an offender who was found to have been committed rape on a girl and killed her\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused was told by the witness that the punishment could be 20 or even 40 years of imprisonment or imprisonment for life\tRatio of the decision\nThereafter the wit- nesses went to see movie in the cinema hall\tRatio of the decision\nDuring cross-examination, Kalu Ram stated that the accused was his neighbour, previously known to him\tRatio of the decision\nOn a pertinent question the witness stated that while making such a query there was no change in the facial expression of the accused, that is, he had remained normal\tRatio of the decision\nSantosh, PW9, did not support the version of Kalu Ram and was declared hostile\tRatio of the decision\nWithout going into the question as to whether the statement of Kalu Ram, PW5 is to be believed or not in view of the same having not been supported by Santosh PW9, let us assess the intrinsic value of such testimony as a piece of incriminating evidence\tRatio of the decision\nIt appears that to begin with the death of S was a blind murder and the police was clue-less about the likely offender\tRatio of the decision\nThe police appears to have embarked upon a search akin to a combing operation and in that process several suspected characters were called and interrogated\tRatio of the decision\nHarish Chand Sharma, PW21 stated that between 19th and 25th March, 1991 the accused Subhash was called at the police station several times for making enquiries\tRatio of the decision\nHe did not remember and was therefore not in a position to tell how many number of times the accused Subhash was called for interrogation or making enquiries\tRatio of the decision\nOn seeing the case diary he stated that on 21.3.1991 the accused was definitely called twice on the same day though there is no mention of what enquiries were made from him\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, the accused was not detained and was sent back\tRatio of the decision\nAny person even if innocent and not connected in any way with a gruesome crime which had recently occurred and was talk of the town, if called by police and interrogated as a suspect, would be scared and be apprehensive of the likelihood of his being implicated in the crime\tRatio of the decision\nPlaced in such situation if a villager, unaware of the law, happens to ask a person, who he feels knows the things better than what he himself does, as to what would be the period of incarceration to be suffered by any person for such an offence the impulse for inquiry may be outcome of a feeling of nervousness or mere inquisitiveness; such an enquiry is not necessarily suggestive of the working of a criminal mind\tRatio of the decision\niii) Recovery of underwear stained with blood and semen Strangely enough the underwear and baniyan though discovered and seized, on an information given by the accused and on his pointing out apparently on a statement recorded under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, have not been produced and exhibited in the court\tRatio of the decision\nWhat happened to these clothes is not known\tRatio of the decision\nThere is not investigation directed towards finding out and no evidence worth its name collected and adduced in the court to show that the underwear and baniyan were of the accused\tRatio of the decision\nInsofar as baniyan is concerned, it has no stains of any type on it and therefore its discovery and seizure is meaningless and irrelevant\tRatio of the decision\nSo far as the underwear is concerned, the investigation suffers from another infirmity also\tRatio of the decision\nBlood sam-ple of the accused was not collected and therefore not grouped\tRatio of the decision\nNo evidence is available to show as to what was the blood group of the accused and therefore the possibility of blood on the underwear being of the accused himself cannot be and is not ruled out\tRatio of the decision\nThe number and extent of spread of stains is also not known\tRatio of the decision\nShri Sushil Kumar Jain, the learned counsel for the accused-appellant has placed reliance on Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit v. State of Maharashtra, AIR (1981\tArgument\nSC 765 1980 Indlaw SC 47\tArgument\nTherein a charge under Sections 376 and 302  IPC  was sought to be substantiated on circumstanctial evidence\tArgument\nOne of the circumstan-tial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of 'B' group was found on the accused's pant which blood group was also of the deceased\tArgument\nAnother circumstantial evidence relied on was that a stain of semen was found on the under-pant of the accused\tArgument\nThis Court held that the presence of blood-stain of 'B' group measuring 0.5 cm\tArgument\nin diameter on the appellant's pant and of a dried stain of semen on his under-pant, were circumstances for too feeble to establish that the appellant raped or murdered the victim\tArgument\nB' group is not uncommon group of blood and no effort was made to exclude the possibility that the blood of the accused belonged to the same group\tArgument\nAs regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant's under-pant, the court observed that the accused was a grown-up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl\tArgument\nIn the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident\tArgument\nOn his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person\tArgument\nPresence of semen stain on underwear, assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard, is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question\tArgument\nSo also the discov-ery of 'B' group blood-stain on the underwear cannot be treated as an incrimi-nating piece of evidence against the accused connecting him with the crime because there is no evidence that the underwear belonged to the accused and further the possiblity of the underwear being stained with the blood of the person to whom it belonged, or the accused if he was wearing it has not been ruled out\tArgument\nFalse plea of alibi\tRatio of the decision\nThe High Court has gone completely amiss in holding that a plea of alibi was taken by the accused and that was found to be false\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused has not stated during his statement under Section 313 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. and nowhere suggested during cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that at the time of the incident he was at a place wherefrom he could not have reached the place of the offence on the date and at the time of its commission\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough the dead body of the victim was found on the outskirts of the village, however, there is no material available on record to fix the place and the likely time at which rape was committed on S and then she was murdered\tRatio of the decision\nWhat is being treated as the plea of alibi by the trial court and the High Court is this\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused appears to have been engaged as a causal (not regular) gate-keeper at 'Hira Moti'-a local talkies\tRatio of the decision\nThe proprietor of the cinema hall was examined to state that on 18th and 19th March the accused had taken leave from his job and during those days he was not present on duty\tRatio of the decision\nThis piece of evidence was put to the accused during his statement under Section 313 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. and in reply he stated 'Galat Hai' (not correct\tRatio of the decision\nThe purpose of asking questions during examination under Section 313 Cr\tRatio of the decision\nP.C. is to afford the accused personally an opportunity of explaining any incriminating circumstance so appearing in evidence against him\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused may or may not avail the opportunity for offering his explanation\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused did not avail the opportunity and stood short by simply stating that the statement of cinema owner was not correct\tRatio of the decision\nLiteral meaning of alibi is 'elsewhere\tRatio of the decision\nIn law this term is used to express that defence in a criminal prosecution, where the party accused, in order to prove that he could not have committed the crime charged against him, offers evidence that he was in a different place at that time\tRatio of the decision\nThe plea taken should be capable of meaning that having regard to the time and place when and where he is alleged to have committed the offence, he could not have been present\tRatio of the decision\nThe plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place\tRatio of the decision\nSee Law Lexicon, P. Ramnath Iyer, Second Edition, P.87\tRatio of the decision\nDenial by an accused of an assertion made by his employer that the accused was on leave of absence from duty on the date of offence does not, by any stretch of reasoning or logic, amount to pleading alibi\tRatio of the decision\nWe are clearly of the opinion that the accused-appellant has not taken a plea of alibi and therefore the question of finding it false, and then drawing an inference adverse to him, does not arise at all\tRatio of the decision\nv) Absconding of the accused Was the accused absconding at all\tRatio of the decision\nGrave injustice has been done to the accused by holding it as a fact that the accused was absconding after the date of the incident and then treating the so-called absconding as a piece of incrimi-nating circumstantial evidence against the accused\tRatio of the decision\nAccording to Harish Chand Sharma, the accused was arrested on 3.4.1991 (vide Exbt\tRatio of the decision\nP/21) at Behror, which is a place situated at a distance of about 30-35 kms\tRatio of the decision\nfrom village Kotputli where the incident had taken place\tRatio of the decision\nThough the accused is alleged to have been arrested at Behror but the memo of arrest was not prepared at Behror; it was prepared at village Kotputli\tRatio of the decision\nThe memo of arrest does not state the arrest of accused having been made at Behror\tRatio of the decision\nIf the accused was arrested at Behror there is no reason why the memo of arrest should not have been prepared at village Behror\tRatio of the decision\nAt least this fact should have been mentioned in the memo of arrest even if the same was prepared at village Kotputli\tRatio of the decision\nSecondly, Harish Chand Sharma himself states that between 19.3.1991 and 25.3.1991 the ac-cused was called several times at the police station and on 21.3.1991 itself he was called twice in a day\tRatio of the decision\nThus, he was always available to the police\tRatio of the decision\nKalu Ram, PW5, accompanied by a friend Santosh, PW9, had gone to see a movie in cinema talkies Heera-Moti two days after the date of the incident and there the accused was present on his duty\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence adduced by the prosecution to hold that soon after the date of the offence the accused was found missing from his residence or the place of his employment and was not available, though searched, at the place or places where normally he ought to have been\tRatio of the decision\nHence, it could not have been held that the accused was absconding\tRatio of the decision\nConclusion\tRatio of the decision\nThus, none of the pieces of evidence relied on as incriminating, by the trial court and the High Court, can be treated as incriminating pieces of circumstantial evidence against the accused\tRatio of the decision\nThough the offence is gruesome and revolts the human conscience but an accused can be convicted only on legal evidence and if only a chain of circumstantial evidence has been so forged as to rule out the possibility of any other reasonable hypothesis excepting the guilt of the accused\tRatio of the decision\nIn Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit's case 1980 Indlaw SC 47 (supra), this Court cautioned - \"human nature is too willing, when faced with brutal crimes, to spin stories out of strong suspicions\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court has held time and again that between may be true and must be true there is a long distance to travel which must be covered by clear, cogent and unimpeachable evidence by the prosecu-tion before an accused is condemned a convict\tRatio of the decision\nThe Trial Court and the High Court have proceeded on an assumption of availability of five pieces forging links in the chain of circumstantial evi-dence out of which we have found, as stated hereinabove, four of the alleged circumstances not to be pieces of incriminating circumstantial evidence at all\tRatio of the decision\nWe are left with circumstance no\tRatio of the decision\n3 only, i.e., recovery of underwear and baniyan stained with semen and human blood group 'B', which alone, in the fact and circumstances of the case discussed hereinabove cannot form basis of conviction of the accused-appellant for the offence charged\tRatio of the decision\nBefore parting with the case we would like to place on record, an observation of ours, touching an aspect of the case\tRatio of the decision\nThere are clueless crimes committed\tRatio of the decision\nThe factum of a cognizable crime having been committed is known but neither the identity of the accused is disclosed nor is there any indication available of the witnesses who would be able to furnish useful and relevant evidence\tRatio of the decision\nSuch offences put to test the wits of an investigating officer\tRatio of the decision\nA vigilant investigating officer, well-versed with the techniques of the job, is in a position to collect the threads of evidence finding out the path which leads to the culprit\tRatio of the decision\nThe ends, which the administration of cirminal justice serves, are not achieved merely by catching hold of the culprit\tRatio of the decision\nThe accusation has to be proved to hilt in a court of law\tRatio of the decision\nThe evidence of investigating officer given in the court should have a rhythm explaining step by step how the investigation proceeded leading to detection of the offender and collection of evidence against him\tRatio of the decision\nThis is necessary to exclude the likelihood of any innocent having been picked up and branded as culprit and then the gravity of the offence arousing human sympathy persuading the mind to be carried away by doubtful or dubious circumstances treating them as of 'beyond doubt' evidentiary value\tRatio of the decision\nThe appeals are allowed\tRuling by Present Court\nConviction of the accused-appellant under Sections 302 and 376(2)(f) of Indian Penal Code is set aside\tRuling by Present Court\nHe is acquitted of the charges framed against him\tRuling by Present Court\nHe shall be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any other offence\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals allowed\tRuling by Present Court\n"}}
