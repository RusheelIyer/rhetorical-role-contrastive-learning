Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Rules, 1963 (for short, 'the 1963 Rules'), it was observed that although there was no specific pleadings raised in this behalf by the Respondents therein nor any question having been referred to the Labour Court by the State Government touching the said issue, it committed an error in granting relief to them on the basis thereof on its own motion\tRuling by Lower Court\nDespite the same the High Court went into the question of applicability of the said Act and held that the 1961 Act and the 1963 Rules had no application\tRuling by Lower Court\nBefore the High Court various documents were produced by the Appellants herein to show the nature of their employment, but the same had not been taken on records by the High Court\tRuling by Lower Court\nAs regard application of the doctrine of 'equal pay for equal work', it was held to be not applicable as the Appellants were not entitled to 'absorption' or 'classification' in terms of the 1961 Act and the 1963 Rules\tRuling by Lower Court\nSUBMISSIONS\tArgument\nDr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the Appellants in Civil Appeal No.337 of 2002 and Mr. M.N. Rao, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the Appellants in Civil Appeal No.335 of 2002, took us through materials on records and contended that the Appellants herein became 'permanent employees' of the Respondents having regard to the provisions contained in S. 2 of the 1961 Act and Order 2(i) and 2(vi) of the Standard Standing Orders as set out in the Annexure appended to the 1963 Rules defining 'permanent employees' and the 'temporary employees\tArgument\nPlacing reliance on several documents which have come into existence at a subsequent stage, Dr. Dhawan would contend that vacancies in fact had arisen after passing of the judgment of the High Court and, thus the services of the Appellants should be regularized there against\tArgument\nThe vacancies, according to the learned counsel, need not be permanent ones\tArgument\nIt was urged that the expression 'clear vacancies' has to be read in the context of period for which the concerned workman was required to work, namely, six months\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would argue that the job was required to be performed for six months for which somebody else could have been appointed so as to attract the provisions of the 1961 Act and the 1963 Rules\tArgument\nDr. Dhawan would furthermore contend that the findings of fact had been arrived at by the Labour Court that the Appellants of Civil Appeal No.337 of 2002 were appointed by the Authority and not only their work was being taken in the Project but also in other works, and, thus, mere posting of the Appellants to the said Project would not disentitle them from the benefit of the said Act\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would urge that a seniority list was also drawn up and an employment code was assigned to each one of the Appellants from which fact the nature of their employment should be judged\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would submit that the sufficient materials were brought on records to show that vacancies were available and as the Appellants worked for a period of more than six months, they became permanent employees in terms of the Act\tArgument\nIt was further contended that as the Respondents despite direction to produce documents including the offers for appointment did not produce the same, an adverse inference should have been drawn against them by the High Court\tArgument\nAs regard the claim of 'equal pay for equal work', the learned counsel would urge that the High Court has failed to consider the same in its true perspective\tArgument\nMr. V.R. Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents, on the other hand, would contend that indisputably the Appellants were engaged by the Respondent-Authority but such appointments were made for the purpose of the Project financed by ODA\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would submit that in fact no appointment letter was issued to the Appellants\tArgument\nOur attention was also drawn to the application dated 22.10.1991 filed by one O.P. Mandloi before the Chairman of the Indore Development Authority disclosing his educational qualifications and enclosing therewith the mark-sheets and degrees obtained by him in Civil Engineering and also Secondary School Examination Certificate to show his date of birth\tArgument\nwhereupon the Chief Executive Officer on the body of the said application itself, made the following endorsement : \"He may be tried in daily wages and should be entrusted with the work of progress collection of ODA work put with (Illegible\tArgument\nSd/- C.E.O. 23.10.91\tArgument\nThe learned counsel would submit that in the aforementioned premise the question of regularization of the services of the Appellants does not arise\tArgument\nDrawing our attention also to the pleadings as also the reliefs claimed for by the Appellants before the Labour Court, the learned counsel would contend that no contention was raised therein by the Appellants as regard their entitlement of permanency in terms of the provisions of the 1961 Act and the 1963 Rules\tArgument\nFurthermore, from the reliefs claimed, it would appear that the Appellants had, inter alia, prayed for continuance of their services by the Indore Municipal Corporation which knocks off the very basis of their claim\tArgument\nIt was urged that there does not exist any controversy that ODA was to continue before 30.6.1997 and as such the Appellants could not have been absorbed by the Respondent authority\tArgument\nSTATUTORY\tStatute\nPROVISIONS : S. 2(2) of the 1961 Act\tStatute\nreads as follows : \"Nothing in this Act shall apply to the employees in an undertaking to whom the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules, Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, Revised Leave Rules, Civil Service Regulations or any other rules or regulations that may be notified in this behalf by the State Government in the official Gazette apply\tStatute\nCl\tStatute\n2 of the Standard Standing Order reads as under : \"2\tStatute\nClassification of employees\tStatute\nEmployees shall be classified as (i) permanent , (ii) permanent seasonal,(iii\tStatute\nProbationers, (iv) Badlies, (v) Apprentices, and (vi) temporary\tStatute\ni\tStatute\nA 'permanent' employee is one who has completed six months' satisfactory service in a clear vacancy in one or more posts whether as a probationer or otherwise, or a person whose name has been entered in the muster roll and who is given a ticket of permanent employee; (vi\tStatute\nTemporary employee' means an employee who has been employed for work which is essentially of a temporary character, or who is temporarily employed as an additional employee in connection with the temporary increase in the work of a permanent nature; provided that in case such employee is required to work continuously for more than six months he shall be deemed to be a permanent employee, within the meaning of cl\tStatute\ni) above\tStatute\nDETERMINATION\tRatio of the decision\nThe Respondent-Authority is a State within the meaning of Art\tRatio of the decision\n12 of the Constitution of India\tPrecedent\nIt is, therefore, constitutionally obliged to strictly comply with the requirements of Arts\tRatio of the decision\n14 and 16 thereof before making any appointment\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not in dispute that the Respondent- Authority has been constituted under Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nibesh Adhiniyam, 1973 (Adhiniyam); S. 47 whereof mandates that all appointments to the posts of officers and servants included in the State cadre mentioned in Section 76-B of the Development Authority Services must be made by the State Government and the appointments to the posts of officers and servants included in the local cadre in the said services by the concerned Town and Country Development Authority\tRatio of the decision\nThe proviso appended to S. 47 of the Adhiniyam further mandates that no post shall be created in any authority without the prior sanction of the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nSection 76B provides for constitution of development authorities service\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not in dispute that the State Government in exercise of its rule making power conferred upon it u/s\tRatio of the decision\n85 of the Adhiniyam has made rules known as 'M.P.

employees in undertakings in the State of Madhya Pradesh\tStatute\nBy reason of the provisions of the said Act, application of Standard Standing Orders to undertakings has been provided in terms whereof the matters to be provided in the Standard Standing Orders have been specified\tStatute\nUnder sub-s\tStatute\n1) of Section 6, the State Government may, by notification, apply Standard Standing Orders to such class of undertakings and from such date as may be specified therein\tStatute\nSub-s\tStatute\n2) of S. 6 reads as under : \"Where immediately before the commencement of this Act standing order are in force in respect of any undertaking, such standing orders shall, until standard standing orders are applied to such undertaking under sub-s\tStatute\n1) continue in force as if they were made under this Act\tStatute\nNo notification has been brought to our notice that the Standard Standing Orders had been made applicable to the Appellants\tRatio of the decision\nIt is furthermore not in dispute that Adhiniyam came into force in 1973\tRatio of the decision\nThe statute, rules and regulations formed by the State govern the terms and conditions of service of the employees of the Respondent\tRatio of the decision\nThe terms of conditions of service contained in the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules are not in derogation of the provisions contained in schedule appended to the 1961 Act\tRatio of the decision\nThe 1961 Act provides for classification of employees in five categories\tRatio of the decision\nThe 1973 Act, as noticed hereinbefore, clearly mandates that all posts should be sanctioned by the State Government and all appointments to the said cadre must be made by the State Government alone\tRatio of the decision\nEven the appointments to the local cadre must be made by the Authority\tRatio of the decision\nThe said provisions were not complied with\tRatio of the decision\nIt is accepted that no appointment letter was issued in favour of the Appellants\tRatio of the decision\nHad the appointments of the Appellants been made in terms of the provisions of the Adhiniyam and Rules framed thereunder, the Respondent-Authority was statutorily enjoined to make an offer of appointment in writing which was to be accepted by the Appellants herein\tRatio of the decision\nWho made the appointments of the Appellants to the Project or other works carried on by the Authority is not known\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the person making an appointment had the requisite jurisdiction or not is also not clear\tRatio of the decision\nWe have noticed hereinbefore that in the case of Om Prakash Mondloi, the CEO made an endorsement to the effect that he may be tried in daily wages and should be entrusted with the work of progress collection of ODA work\tRatio of the decision\nThe said order is not an 'offer of appointment' by any sense of term\tRatio of the decision\nIt may be true that the Appellants had been later on put on a monthly salary but there is nothing on record to show as to how the same was done\tRatio of the decision\nThey might have been subjected to the provisions of the employees provident fund and might have been granted the benefit of leave or given some employment code and their names might have found place in the seniority list amongst others, but thereby they cannot be said to have been given a permanent ticket\tRatio of the decision\nThe so-called seniority list which is contained in Annexure P-27, whereupon strong reliance has been placed by Dr. Dhawan merely itself goes to show that it was prepared in respect of office muster employees\tRatio of the decision\nThe said seniority list was not prepared in terms of the classification of employees within the meaning of the 1961 Act and the rules framed there under but was based on the date of joining probably for the purpose of maintenance of records\tRatio of the decision\nThe 1973 Act or the rules framed there under do not provide for appointments on ad hoc basis or on daily wages\tRatio of the decision\nThe 1961 Act itself shows that the employees are to be classified in six categories, namely, permanent, permanent seasonal, probationers, badlies, apprentices and temporary\tRatio of the decision\nThe recruitments of the Appellants do not fall in any of the said categories\tRatio of the decision\nWith a view to become eligible to be considered as a permanent employee or a temporary employee, one must be appointed in terms thereof\tRatio of the decision\nPermanent employee has been divided in two categories (i) who had been appointed against a clear vacancy in one or more posts as probationers and otherwise; and (ii) whose name had been registered at muster roll and who has been given a ticket of permanent employee\tRatio of the decision\nA 'ticket of permanent employee' was, thus, required to be issued in terms of Order 3 of the Standard Standing Orders\tRatio of the decision\nGrant of such ticket was imperative before permanency could be so claimed\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants have not produced any such ticket\tRatio of the decision\nIt is not the case of the Appellants that they had been working as Technical Supervisors and Clerks in respect of which service book may be maintained instead of issuance of a ticket\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also not the case of the Appellants that their names had appeared in the service book maintained for the said purpose\tRatio of the decision\nThe Standing Orders governing the terms and conditions of service must be read subject to the Constitutional limitations wherever applicable\tRatio of the decision\nConstitution being the suprema lax, shall prevail over all other statutes\tRatio of the decision\nThe only provision as regard recruitment of the employees is contained in Order 4 which merely provides that the Manager shall within a period of six months, lay down the procedure for recruitment of employees and notify it on the notice board on which Standing Orders are exhibited and shall send copy thereof to the Labour Commissioner\tRatio of the decision\nThe matter relating to recruitment is governed by the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules\tRatio of the decision\nIn absence of any specific directions contained in the schedule appended to the Standing Orders, the statute and the statutory rules applicable to the employees of the Respondent shall prevail\tRatio of the decision\nIn M.P. Vidyut Karamchari Sangh vs. M.P. Electricity Board [(2004) 9 SCC 755], 2004 Indlaw SC 198 a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that a regulation which is not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1961 Act and the Rules, can be issued by a statutory authority\tPrecedent\nFor the purpose of this matter, we would proceed on the basis that the 1961 Act is a special statute\tRatio of the decision\nvis-a-vis the 1973 Act and the rules framed thereunder\tRatio of the decision\nBut in absence of any conflict in the provisions of the said Act, the conditions of service including those relating to recruitment as provided for in the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules would apply\tRatio of the decision\nIf by reason of the latter, the appointment is invalid, the same cannot be validated by taking recourse to regularization\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of regularization which would confer on the concerned employee a permanent status, there must exist a post\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, we may hasten to add that regularization itself does not imply permanency\tRatio of the decision\nWe have used the term keeping in view the provisions of 1963 Rules\tRatio of the decision\nWe have noticed the provisions of the Act and the Rules\tRatio of the decision\nNo case was made out by the Appellants herein in their statements of claim that they became permanent employees in terms thereof\tRatio of the decision\nThere is also nothing on records to show that such a claim was put forward even in the demand raising the industrial dispute\tRatio of the decision\nPresumably, the Appellants were aware of the statutory limitations in this behalf\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore, the Labour Court having derived its jurisdiction from the reference made by the State Government, it was bound to act within the four-corners thereof\tRatio of the decision\nIt could not enlarge the scope of the reference nor could deviate therefrom\tRatio of the decision\nA demand which was not raised at the time of raising the dispute could not have been gone into by the Labour Court being not the subject-matter thereof\tRatio of the decision\nThe questions which have been raised before us by Dr. Dhawan had not been raised before the Labour Court\tRatio of the decision\nThe Labour Court in absence of any pleadings or any proof as regard application of the 1961 Act and the 1963 Rules had proceeded on the basis that they would become permanent employees in terms of Order 2(ii) and 2(vi) of the Annexure appended thereto\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants did not adduce any evidence as regard nature of their employment or the classification under which they were appointed\tRatio of the decision\nThey have also not been able to show that they had been issued any permanent ticket\tRatio of the decision\nDr. Dhawan is not correct in his submission that a separate ticket need not be issued and what was necessary was merely to show that the Appellants had been recognized by the State as its employees having been provided with employment code\tRatio of the decision\nWe have seen that their names had been appearing in the muster rolls maintained by the Respondent\tRatio of the decision\nThe Scheme of the employees provident fund or the leave rules would not alter the nature and character of their appointments\tRatio of the decision\nThe nature of their employment continues save and except a case where a statute interdicts which in turn would be subject to the Constitutional limitations\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of obtaining a permanent status, constitutional and statutory conditions precedent therefor must be fulfilled\tRatio of the decision\nThe submission of Mr. M.N. Rao to the effect that the principle of equity should be invoked in their case is stated to be rejected\tArgument\nSuch a plea had expressly been rejected by this Court in A. Umarani 2004 Indlaw SC 606 (supra\tArgument\nPROJECT WORK\tRatio of the decision\nThis case involves 31 employees\tRatio of the decision\nA distinction is sought to be made by Dr. Dhawan that out of them 27 had been appointed to a project and not in a project\tRatio of the decision\nThe distinction although appears to be attractive at the first blush but does not stand a moment's scrutiny\tRatio of the decision\nAs noticed hereinbefore, the High Court's observation remained unchallenged, that the project was to be financed by ODA\tRatio of the decision\nThe project was indisputably to be executed by the Indore Development Authority; and for the implementation thereof, the appointments had to be made by it\tRatio of the decision\nIf the Appellants were appointed for the purpose of the project, they would be deemed to have been appointed therefor and only because such appointments had been made by the Respondent would by itself not entitle them to claim permanency\tRatio of the decision\nThe life of the project came to an end on 30.6.1997\tRatio of the decision\nThe maintenance job upon completion thereof had been taken over by Indore Municipal Corporation\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants were aware of the said fact and, thus, raised an alternative plea in their statements of claims\tRatio of the decision\nThe Labour Court could not have granted any relief to them as prayed for, as Indore Municipal Corporation is a separate juristic person having been created under a statute\tRatio of the decision\nSuch a relief would have been beyond the scope and purport of the reference made to the Labour Court by the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore, the Indore Municipal Corporation was not a party and, thus, no employee could be thrust upon it without its consent\tRatio of the decision\nIn A Umarani 2004 Indlaw SC 606 (supra), this Court held that once the employees are employed for the purpose of the scheme, they do not acquire any vested right to continue after the project is over\tPrecedent\nSee also Karnataka State Coop\tPrecedent\nApex Bank Ltd\tPrecedent\nVs\tPrecedent\nY.S.

Electricity Board vs. Hariram etc. [2004 AIR SCW 5476\tPrecedent\n2004 Indlaw SC 829, this Court observed : \"In such a factual background, in our opinion, the Industrial Court or the High Court could not have drawn an adverse inference for the non-production of the Muster Rolls for the year 1990 to 1992 in the absence of specific pleading by the respondents-applicants that at least during that period they had worked for 240 days continuously in a given year\tPrecedent\nThe application calling for the production of the documents was for the years 1987 to 1992\tPrecedent\nAs stated above, between the period 1987 to 1990, as a matter of fact, till end of the year 1990 the respondents have not been able to establish the case of continuous work for 240 days\tPrecedent\nConsidering these facts in our view drawing of an adverse inference for the non- production of the Muster Rolls for the years 1991-92, is wholly erroneous on the part of the Industrial Court and the High Court\tPrecedent\nWe cannot but bear in mind the fact that the initial burden of establishing the factum of their continuous work for 240 days in a year rests with the applicants-respondents\tPrecedent\nThe above burden having not been discharged and the Labour Court having held so, in our opinion, the Industrial Court and the High Court erred in basing an order of re-instatement solely on an adverse inference drawn erroneously\tPrecedent\nAt this stage it may be useful to refer to a judgment of this Court in the case of Muncipal Corporation, Faridabad vs. Siri Niwas (JT 2004 (7) SC 248) 2004 Indlaw SC 719 wherein this Court disagreed with the High Court's view of drawing an adverse inference in regard to the non-production of certain relevant documents\tPrecedent\nThis is what this Court had to say in that regard\tPrecedent\nA Court of Law even in a case where provisions of the Indian Evidence Act apply, may presume or may not presume that if a party despite possession of the best evidence had not produced the same, it would have gone against his contentions\tPrecedent\nThe matter, however, would be different where despite direction by a court the evidence is withheld\tPrecedent\nPresumption as to adverse inference for non- production of evidence is always optional and one of the factors which is required to be taken into consideration in the background of facts involved in the lis\tPrecedent\nThe presumption, thus, is not obligatory because notwithstanding the intentional non- production, other circumstances may exist upon which such intentional non-production may be found to be justifiable on some reasonable grounds\tPrecedent\nIn the instant case, the Industrial Tribunal did not draw any adverse inference against the Appellant\tPrecedent\nIt was within its jurisdiction to do so particularly having regard to the nature of the evidence adduced by the Respondent\tPrecedent\nIn any event, in this case, we have proceeded on the basis that the assertions of the Appellants as regard nature of their employment, their continuance in the job for a long time are correct and as such the question as to whether any adverse inference should be drawn for alleged production of documents called for would take a back seat\tRatio of the decision\nEQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK\tRatio of the decision\nThe Appellants having been employed on daily wages did not hold any post\tRatio of the decision\nNo post was sanctioned by the State Government\tRatio of the decision\nThey were not appointed in terms of the provisions of the statute\tRatio of the decision\nThey were not, therefore, entitled to take the recourse of the doctrine of 'equal pay for equal work' as adumbrated in Arts\tRatio of the decision\n14 and 39(d) of the Constitution of India\tRatio of the decision\nThe burden was on the Appellants to establish that they had a right to invoke the said doctrine in terms of Art\tRatio of the decision\n14 of the Constitution of India\tRatio of the decision\nFor the purpose of invoking the said doctrine, the nature of the work and responsibility attached to the post are some of the factors which were bound to be taken into consideration\tRatio of the decision\nFurthermore, when their services had not been regularized and they had continued on a consolidated pay on ad hoc basis having not undergone the process of regular appointments, no direction to give regular pay scale could have been issued by the Labour Court\tRatio of the decision\nSee Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology and Another vs. Manoj K. Mohanty (2003) 5 SCC 188 2003 Indlaw SC 348\tRatio of the decision\nIn State of Haryana and Another vs. Tilak Raj and Others [(2003) 6 SCC 123] 2003 Indlaw SC 512, it was held : \"A scale of pay is attached to a definite post and in case of a daily-wager, he hold no posts\tPrecedent\nThe respondent workers cannot be held to hold any posts to claim even comparison with the regular and permanent staff for any or all purposes including a claim for equal pay and allowances\tPrecedent\nTo claim a relief on the basis of equality, it is for the claimants to substantiate a clear-cut basis of equivalence and a resultant hostile discrimination before becoming eligible to claim rights on a par with the other group vis-'-vis an alleged discrimination\tPrecedent\nNo material was placed before the High Court as to the nature of the duties of either categories and it is not possible to hold that the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" is an abstract one\tPrecedent\nThe said decision has been noticed in A. Umarani 2004 Indlaw SC 606 (supra\tRatio of the decision\nCONCLUSION\tRuling by Present Court\nFor the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in these appeals, which are dismissed accordingly\tRuling by Present Court\nThere shall, however, be no order as to costs\tRuling by Present Court\nAppeals dismissed\tRuling by Present Court\n"}}
