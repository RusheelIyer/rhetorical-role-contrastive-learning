by Lower Court\nMs. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the evidence of the witnesses suffers from material discrepancy and is self- contradictory\tArgument\nIt was submitted that injured witness Sukhbir was not examined in the court and neither CT Scan nor x-ray nor operational notes of Sukhbir were produced before the court and in the absence of such material evidence, courts below erred in convicting the second accused u/s\tArgument\n307 IPC\tRatio of the decision\nAdditionally, the learned counsel contended that the defence plea of private defence was not considered by the courts below in proper perspective\tArgument\nPer contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-State contended that the evidence of all the witnesses satisfactorily establishes the overt act of the accused persons and Jagdish (PW-5) and Mange Ram (PW-6) being the injured witnesses, the veracity of these witnesses cannot be doubted\tArgument\nIt was submitted that the medical evidence sufficiently corroborated the oral evidence and the prosecution has established the intention of the 2nd accused in causing attempt to commit murder of Sukhbir and in appreciation of the evidence, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the second accused u/s\tArgument\n307 IPC and the same warrants no interference\tArgument\nWe have carefully considered the rival contentions and gone through the impugned judgment and perused the materials on record\tRatio of the decision\nAs it emerges from the evidence, complainant Jagdish (PW-5) and his two sons Sukhbir and Mange Ram were cutting pullas\tRatio of the decision\nThe accused party went there and asked them not to cut the pullas\tRatio of the decision\nIn the wordy altercation, second accused Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju gave pharsi blows on the head of Sukhbir\tRatio of the decision\nPWs 5 & 6 have clearly spoken about the overt act of the accused that A-1 Jage Ram attacked and caused injury to PW-5 Jagdish with jaily blows and that second accused Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju attacked on the head of Sukhbir with pharsi\tRatio of the decision\nThey have also stated that Madan and Rakesh caused injuries to PW5-Jagdish with lathi on shoulder and left elbow respectively\tRatio of the decision\nPW\tRatio of the decision\n2- Dr. Pardeep Kumar in his evidence stated that he has examined PWs 5 and 6 and noted the injuries on the body of PWs 5 and 6 and issued wound certificates\tRatio of the decision\nEvidence of PWs 5 and 6 is amply corroborated by medical evidence\tRatio of the decision\nPWs 5 and 6 being injured witnesses, their evidence is entitled to great weight\tRatio of the decision\nCogent and convincing grounds are required to discard the evidence of injured witnesses\tRatio of the decision\nIn the light of the fact that PWs 5 and 6 were injured witnesses, courts below tested their evidence for its credibility and recorded concurrent findings that PWs 5 and 6 are trustworthy witnesses\tRatio of the decision\nWe find no reason to take a different view\tRatio of the decision\nAppellants have raised the contention that the prosecution failed to adduce evidence that A-2 Rajbir attempted to commit murder of Sukhbir\tArgument\nIt was submitted that injured person Sukhbir was neither examined nor medical evidence like CT Scan, x-ray and operational notes and Sukhbir were produced to corroborate the oral evidence and while so courts below erred in convicting second accused Rajbir\tArgument\nDr. Pardeep Kumar-PW-2, who examined Sukhbir found during his medico-legal examination a lacerated wound in the middle of the top of the skull\tFacts\nInjured-Sukhkbir was found vomiting in the hospital and he was examined by a Neuro Surgeon Dr. Hilol Kanti Pal (PW-9) of Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi on 19.11.1994, i.e. the day after the incident\tFacts\nPW-9 has stated that Sukhbir was unconscious since 2.00 P.M. on 18.11.1994 and was deeply comatose with irregularity of pupils and a laceration was diagnosed on the right front parietal region\tFacts\nFurther, PW-9 has stated that during the CT scan, it was revealed that a large extra-dural haemotoma was present in the frontal region with mass effect and to avoid further deterioration of his condition, he was operated upon by frontal trephine craniopmy an haemotoma measuring about 125 ml was evacuated\tFacts\nPW-9\tFacts\nstated that had not the operation been conducted on Sukhbir and had not the extra-dural haemotoma removed by operation urgently, the head injury caused to Sukhbir would have caused his death\tFacts\nAs noted by the High Court, it is thus brought on evidence that had not surgical assistance been given to Sukhbir, he would have definitely died\tFacts\nFor the purpose of conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC, prosecution has to establish (i) the intention to commit murder and (ii) the act done by the accused\tRatio of the decision\nThe burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness\tRatio of the decision\nWhether the accused person intended to commit murder of another person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case\tRatio of the decision\nTo justify a conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC, it is not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused\tRatio of the decision\nAlthough the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nThe intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc\tRatio of the decision\nIn the case of State of M.P. vs. Kashiram & Ors\tPrecedent\nAIR 2009\tPrecedent\nSC 1642\tPrecedent\n2009) 4 SCC 26 2009 Indlaw SC 92, the scope of intention for attracting conviction u/s\tPrecedent\n307 IPC was elaborated and it was held as under\tPrecedent\nIt is sufficient to justify a conviction u/s\tPrecedent\n307 if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof\tPrecedent\nIt is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted\tPrecedent\nThe section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any\tPrecedent\nThe court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section\tPrecedent\nTherefore, an accused charged u/s\tPrecedent\n307 IPC cannot be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt\tPrecedent\nThis position was highlighted in State of Maharashtra v. Balram Bama Patil, (1983) 2 SCC 28 1983 Indlaw SC 414, Girija Shanker v. State of U.P.(2004) 3 SCC 793 2004 Indlaw SC 78 and R. Prakash v. State of Karnataka (2004) 9 SCC 27 2004 Indlaw SC 117\tPrecedent\nWhether there was intention to kill or knowledge that death will be caused is a question of fact and would depend on the facts of a given case\tPrecedent\nThe circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of S. 307 IPC\tPrecedent\nThe determinative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and not the nature of the injury\tPrecedent\nState of M.P. v. Saleem (2005) 5 SCC 554 2005 Indlaw SC 413 Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats\tPrecedent\nIt is, therefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed, etc\tPrecedent\nThis position was illuminatingly stated by this Court in Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N.(1991) 3 SCC 471 1991 Indlaw SC 683\tPrecedent\nHaving regard to the weapon used for causing the head injuries to Sukhbir, nature of injures, situs of the injury and the severity of the blows, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the 2nd appellant u/s\tRatio of the decision\nIn our considered view, the conviction of the second appellant Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC is unassailable\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel for the appellants contended that the second appellant is in custody for more than three years and since the occurrence was in the year 1994, prayed for reduction of the sentence imposed on the second appellant to the period already undergone\tArgument\nPlacing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Hari Singh vs. Sukhbir Singh & Ors (1988) 4 SCC 551 1988 Indlaw SC 27., learned counsel for the appellants additionally submitted that in terms of S. 357 (3) Cr\tArgument\nP.C. that the compensation may be awarded to the victim and the sentence be modified to the period already undergone\tArgument\nFor the conviction u/s\tRatio of the decision\n307 IPC, courts below imposed upon the 2nd appellant rigorous imprisonment of five years, while imposing punishment, courts have an obligation to award appropriate punishment\tRatio of the decision\nQuestion of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and the same has to be exercised by the courts taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances\tRatio of the decision\nWhat sentence would meet the ends of justice would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the courts must keep in mind the gravity of the offence, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances\tPrecedent\nVide State of M.P. vs. Bablu Natt (2009) 2 SCC 272 2008 Indlaw SC 2027; Alister Anthony Pareira vs. State of Maharashtra (2012) 2 SCC 648 2012 Indlaw SC 12 and Soman vs. State of Kerala (2013) 11 SCC 382 2012 Indlaw SC\tPrecedent\nIn the light of the above, considering the case in hand, the occurrence was of the year 1994 when the complainant party was cutting pullas, the accused asked them not to cut the pullas which resulted in the wordy altercation\tRatio of the decision\nIn the heat of passion, the accused have caused injuries to the complainant party\tRatio of the decision\nThe second accused Rajbir\tRuling by Present Court\nRaju is in custody\tRatio of the decision\nHe surrendered on 5.1.2012 and is stated to be in custody since then, for more than three years\tRatio of the decision\nHaving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, in our considered view, the period of sentence of five years may be reduced to three years apart from directing the second appellant Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju to pay substantial compensation to injured-Sukhbir\tRatio of the decision\nAs noticed above, injured-Sukhbir sustained grievous head injuries and was deeply comatose and was in a state of shock and trauma\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel for the injured-witness submitted that for quite some time injured-Sukhbir was unconscious and thereafter suffering from mental trauma\tArgument\nHaving regard to the nature of injuries sustained by Sukhbir and the period of treatment and other circumstances, we are of the view that, it would be appropriate to direct second appellant- accused Rajbir\tRatio of the decision\nRaju to pay Rs.7,50,000/- as compensation to the injured-Sukhbir\tRatio of the decision\nWhen the matter came up for hearing on 14.10.2014, learned counsel for the appellants informed the Court that he had offered Rs.5,00,000/- by way of demand draft towards compensation to the injured-Sukhbir in the presence of the Sarpanch of the village which he has refused to receive the same\tRatio of the decision\nThe said amount of Rs.5,00,000/- is now kept in fixed deposit in the Registry of this Court\tRatio of the decision\nFor inflicting blows on PW-5 Jagidsh with jaily A-1 Jage Ram was convicted u/s\tRuling by Lower Court\n325 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year.
