Sundaravardhan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant very forcefully submitted that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the order of acquittal passed in respect of the present appellant\tArgument\nHe submitted that although the incident in question had taken place at about 8.45 p.m. the same came to be reported to the police at 3.00 a.m\tArgument\nHe also submitted that the police officer (PW-21) who received the information about the incident started investigation without recording either any general diary (for short G.D.) entry or the FIR and, therefore, the FIR which has been proved in the trial court is hit by the provisions of S. 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short \"the CrPC\tArgument\nHe also submitted that the High Court has not given any reason for setting aside the appeal against acquittal which was passed after appreciating the entire evidence on record\tArgument\nHe further submitted that there was not only shifting of time of the alleged occurrence but also shifting of the place of occurrence from the hall to the outside verandah and courtyard to suit the convenience of the prosecution case\tArgument\nHe has drawn our attention towards the entire evidence on record including the cross-examination part and with the help of the same he submitted that the entire alleged incident in question had taken place when there was complete darkness at the scene of occurrence\tArgument\nA scuffle started between the nephew and the uncle in which the accused persons also received injuries and, therefore, the right of private defence of the appellant was available and in that view of the matter, the order of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside\tArgument\nIt was further submitted that the alleged eye-witnesses of the occurrence were examined by the police belatedly and that the medical evidence adduced in the case does not in any manner support the ocular evidence and if at all it would not be a case of culpable homicide amounting to murder but a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder\tArgument\nHe also submitted that if two views are possible and if there are lacunae in the case of the prosecution, the benefit must go to the accused\tArgument\nHe next submitted that there was no evidence on record as to when the FIR reached the Magistrate and that none of the courts below considered the said aspect\tArgument\nHe submitted that since there was violation of the provisions of S. 162 of the CrPC, the accused-appellant is liable to be acquitted\tArgument\nMs. A. Subhashini, learned counsel appearing for the respondent- State, however, strenuously submitted that none of the aforesaid submissions could be accepted by this Court as it is a foolproof case of conviction of the appellant u/s\tArgument\n302 IPC\tRatio of the decision\nShe submitted that the High Court rightly interfered with the order of acquittal passed by the trial court after critically examining the evidence on record\tArgument\nIt was submitted by her that the trial court examined the evidence in the present case in a very summary and cryptic manner and thereby arrived at a wrong conclusion that the accused persons were required to be acquitted\tArgument\nShe has drawn our attention to the findings recorded by the High Court while setting aside the order of acquittal observing that the evidence of eye-witnesses namely PWs\tArgument\n1, 2, 8 and 18 is convincing and reliable but so far as the evidence of PW-4 is concerned, the High Court has made an observation that he is not a reliable witness\tArgument\nCounsel for the respondent has, therefore, taken us through the evidence of PWs\tArgument\n1, 2, 8 and 18 and on the basis thereof submitted that their evidence clearly prove and establish the role of the appellant herein in stabbing the deceased with the knife which he had brought from the other room with the intention of killing the deceased and, therefore, it is a clear case of conviction\tArgument\nu/s\tArgument\nIn the light of the aforesaid submissions of the counsel appearing for the parties we have given our in-depth consideration to the facts of the present case\tRatio of the decision\nThe starting point of the incident in question as indicated from the evidence on record is the hall where apparently a dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house\tRatio of the decision\nThe deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nAt this, the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also clear and established that thereafter a lamp was brought by Accused No. 3 to the room besides another lamp which was already burning in the said room itself\tRatio of the decision\nBut, in any case, there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house\tRatio of the decision\nThere is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place\tRatio of the decision\nThere was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which Accused No. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant\tRatio of the decision\nThe said fact is proved by the evidence of PWs\tRatio of the decision\n2, 8, 18 and the complainant herself (PW-1\tRatio of the decision\nThe deceased was taken to the hospital and while so taken he died\tRatio of the decision\nPW-21 who was at that time attached to Konda Police Station as PSI was informed at about 10.45 p.m. that the deceased while was being brought in the police jeep by a police constable Jaisingrao Rane and was being taken to the Government Medical College but before the deceased could be admitted he died\tRatio of the decision\nPW-21 was also informed by said by said PSI K.K. Desai of Panaji Police Station that it was a case of assault and that the incident had taken place at verandah and that the said matter pertains to his police station and, therefore, he should take appropriate action\tRatio of the decision\nOn receiving the said message he went to the place of occurrence along with PSI K.K. Desai and upon reaching the place of occurrence at 11.30 p.m. he found the entire place plunged in total darkness\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, he proceeded to survey the place of occurrence with the help of torches\tRatio of the decision\nHe, in his deposition specifically stated that he found that the back door as well as the front door of the house were latched from inside and in front of the house there was a road where there was an electricity pole and there was a street tube light by which the house could be visible and even the lights of the vehicles were flashed at the house\tRatio of the decision\nHe stated that although the house had electricity connection, but was not having the electricity supply\tRatio of the decision\nHe gave instructions to his subordinate and also to the people around that nobody should touch any article lying at the scene of occurrence\tRatio of the decision\nHe stated that he made preliminary enquiry and brought Yashoda and her two daughters to the police station and sent two other officers in search of Accused Nos\tRatio of the decision\n1 and 2 who were not found in the house\tRatio of the decision\nHe also stated that he got the complaint registered at the police station which was lodged by PW-1 and that on the next day he again went to the scene of offence and seized the properties involved in the crime which were sealed\tRatio of the decision\nHe also recovered the knife at the instance of accused Sharmila which he seized\tRatio of the decision\nOn 28.04.1988, that is, after about 9 days of the incident, Accused Nos\tRatio of the decision\n1 and 2 surrendered before the police and on their surrender they were taken into custody\tRatio of the decision\nIt was found that Accused No. 1 was having injury on his back\tRatio of the decision\nand he was medically examined\tRatio of the decision\nOn medical examination his injury was found to be simple\tRatio of the decision\nLearned counsel appearing for the appellant was critical of the manner in which PW-21 initiated the investigation without recording any G.D. entry and without getting any FIR recorded\tArgument\nHe submitted that since the investigation in the instant case was started by the police without recording an FIR, such an FIR is necessarily hit by the provisions of S. 162 of the Cr\tArgument\nP.C\tArgument\nHe next submitted that no evidence having been led by the prosecution about the time when the FIR reached the Magistrate, therefore, there is also violation of the provisions of S. 157 of the Cr\tArgument\nThe issue with regard to the initiation of the investigation without recording the FIR was succinctly addressed by this Court in the case of State of U.P. v. Bhagwant Kishore Joshi, (1964) 3 SCR 71 1963 Indlaw SC 268, observed as follows: \"17\tPrecedent\nWhat is investigation is not defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure; but in H.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. State of Delhi 1954 Indlaw SC 14 this Court has described, the procedure, for investigation as follows: \"Thus, under the Code investigation consists generally of the following steps, (1) Proceeding to the spot, (2) Ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case, (3) Discovery and arrest of the suspected offender, (4) Collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of (a) the examination of various persons (including the accused) and the reduction of their statements into writing, if the officer thinks fit, (b) the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial, and (5) formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge-sheet u/s\tPrecedent\nThis Court, however, has not said that if a police officer takes merely one or two of the steps indicated by it, what he has done must necessarily be regarded as investigation\tPrecedent\nInvestigation, in substance, means collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence\tPrecedent\nThe Investigating Officer is, for this purpose, entitled to question persons who, in this opinion, are able to throw light on the offence which has been committed and is likewise entitled to question the suspect and is entitled to reduce the statements of persons questioned by him to writing\tPrecedent\nHe is also entitled to search the place of the offence and to search other places with the object of seizing articles connected with the offence\tPrecedent\nNo doubt, for this purpose he has to proceed to the spot where the offence was committed and do various other things\tPrecedent\nBut the main object of investigation being to bring home the offence to the offender the essential part of the duties of an investigating officer in this connection is, apart from arresting the offender, to collect all material necessary for establishing the accusation against the offender\tPrecedent\nMerely making some preliminary enquire upon receipt of information from an anonymous source or a source of doubtful reliability for checking up the correctness of the information does not amount to collection of evidence and so cannot be regarded as investigation\tPrecedent\nIn the absence of any prohibition in the Code, express or implied, I am of opinion that it is open to a police officer to make preliminary enquiries before registering an offence and making a full scale investigation into it\tPrecedent\nNo doubt, Section 5-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted for preventing harassment to a government servant and with this object in view investigation, except with the previous permission of a Magistrate, is not permitted to be made by an officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police\tPrecedent\nWhere, however, a police officer makes some preliminary enquiries, does not arrest or even question an accused or question any witnesses but merely makes a few discreet enquiries or looks at some documents without making any notes, it is difficult to visualise how any possible harassment or even embarrassment would result therefrom to the suspect or the accused person\tPrecedent\nIf no harassment to the accused results from the action of a police officer how can it be said to defeat the purpose underlying Section 5-A\tPrecedent\nLooking at the matter this way, I hold that what Mathur did was something very much short of investigation and, therefore, the provisions of Section 5-A were not violated\tPrecedent\nSince no irregularity was committed by him there is no occasion to invoke the aid of the curative provisions of the Code\tPrecedent\nemphasis underlined\tPrecedent\nIn the instant case, it is quite clear from the evidence on record that PW-1 received the information about the death of the deceased from PSI of Panaji Police Station without any detail as to how the incident had happened and who had caused the incident\tRatio of the decision\nIt was a very cryptic information received by him regarding the death of a person residing within the jurisdiction of his police station pursuant to an incident taking place on 10.04.1988 between 8.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. and, therefore, it appears that there was not enough information available to him either to get a G.D. entry recorded or to get an FIR lodged\tRatio of the decision\nIn order to verify the information received, PW-21 went to the place of occurrence and found the entire house in total darkness\tRatio of the decision\nHe went around the house and saw blood marks on the walls of the verandah and also in the courtyard and came to learn about the incident by using torch light\tRatio of the decision\nWhen he reached at the place of occurrence even the complainant party was not available there\tRatio of the decision\nbut at a later stage they came there\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, he brought them along with the residents of the house who were found to be there namely Accused No. 3 and the two juvenile offenders namely Sarita and Sharmila, who were all ladies\tRatio of the decision\nAfter reaching the police station and at the request of PW-1 the FIR was recorded at 3.00 a.m. in the morning\tRatio of the decision\nHe received the information about the incident on telephone at about 10.45 p.m. and reached the place of occurrence at about 11.30 p.m. and he must have been there for quite some time and thereafter returned to the police station which must have taken another about 1.30 to 2 hours\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, recording of the FIR at about 3.00 a.m. in the morning was justified and properly explained and it cannot be said that there was any delay in recording the FIR\tRatio of the decision\nBesides, the fact of his going to the place of occurrence would not amount to making an investigation\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence to show that at that point of time, PW-21 seized any articles or interrogated any witnesses or took any other action in initiating or in furtherance of investigation\tRatio of the decision\nThe ratio of the decision in Bhagwant Kishore Joshi 1963 Indlaw SC 268 (supra) is applicable to the facts of the present case as the police officer merely visited the spot and place of occurrence and made some survey which cannot be regarded as investigation\tRatio of the decision\nIn Animireddy Venkata Ramana and Others v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of Andhra Pradesh, (2008) 5 SCC 368, 2008 Indlaw SC 354 , this Court while considering a similar case observed as follows: \" 10\tPrecedent\nCertain basic facts are not denied or disputed\tPrecedent\nThe deceased died in the bus at about 10.30 p.m. on 23-6-1998 while travelling to his village home from Tuni\tPrecedent\nPW 1 also sustained injuries in the said incident\tPrecedent\nImmediately after the incident, hearing cries of passengers, the driver of the bus stopped the bus\tPrecedent\nNot only the accused persons fled away, all others also did, including PWs 3 and 4\tPrecedent\nThey came back after a short while hearing the cries of PW 1\tPrecedent\nThey acceded to his request to take the bus to his house\tPrecedent\nFrom the records, it appears that the distance between the place where the accident took place and the village in question was not much\tPrecedent\nIn any event, the destination of the bus was the said village and they were bound to take the bus thereat\tPrecedent\nPW 1 informed about the incident to PW 2, another son of the deceased\tPrecedent\nThe dead body of the deceased was brought down from the bus and taken to the house\tPrecedent\nThe conductor of the bus sent an information to the Depot Manager of the State Road Transport Corporation at Tuni\tPrecedent\nThe investigating officer was also informed\tPrecedent\nA report to that effect might have been noted in the general diary but the same could not have been treated to be an FIR\tPrecedent\nWhen an information is received by an officer in charge of a police station, he in terms of the provisions of the Code was expected to reach the place of occurrence as early as possible\tPrecedent\nIt was not necessary for him to take that step only on the basis of a first information report\tPrecedent\nAn information received in regard to commission of a cognizable offence is not required to be preceded by a first information report\tPrecedent\nDuty of the State to protect the life of an injured as also an endeavour on the part of the responsible police officer to reach the place of occurrence in a situation of this nature is his implicit duty and responsibility\tPrecedent\nIf some incident had taken place in a bus, the officers of Road Transport Corporation also could not ignore the same\tPrecedent\nThey reached the place of occurrence in another bus at about 1 a.m\tPrecedent\nThe deceased and the injured were only then shifted to Tuni Hospital\tPrecedent\nThe ratio of the aforesaid decision is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case\tRatio of the decision\nEven assuming that PW-21, the Investigating Officer could have entered the aforesaid information received from PSI of Panaji Police Station in the general diary, yet they said entry could not have been held or treated to be an FIR\tRatio of the decision\nThe information received by him was very cryptic and without any detail about the incident in question and, therefore, in any case, there was no possibility of recording an FIR at that stage\tRatio of the decision\nThe place of occurrence was in total darkness and even the persons belonging to the complainant side were not available, therefore, bringing them to the police station where there was sufficient light and recording the complaint at 3.00 a.m. cannot, in any manner, cast any doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case\tRatio of the decision\nIn that view of the matter it cannot be said that the FIR was in any manner hit by the provisions of S. 162 of CrPC\tRatio of the decision\nSo far contention that there was violation of S. 157 of the CrPC is concerned, the same is also without any basis for the defence never cross-examined PW-21 on the aforesaid issue\tRatio of the decision\nSo long the defence is not able to establish from the records by cogent evidence that there was any delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate, it cannot be held that there was any such delay\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no evidence on record before us to hold either way for no such issue was raised either before the trial court or before the High Court nor any evidence was led by the defence in respect of the said issue which is sought to be raised at this stage\tRatio of the decision\nFrom the evidence on record it does not appear to us that any suggestion was given to the said witness to the effect that the copy of the FIR was not sent or that it was dispatched late, which if given, would have given an opportunity to the witness to afford some explanation or to show as to when the FIR, was sent to and received by the Magistrate\tRatio of the decision\nIn that view of the matter we do not agree with the counsel appearing for the appellant that delay in transmitting the FIR to the Magistrate stands proved in the present case\tRatio of the decision\nThe next contention that we proceed to discuss now is about whether sufficient light was available at the place of occurrence for the eye- witnesses to see the occurrence as stated by them in the evidence\tRatio of the decision\nWe have PWs\tRatio of the decision\n1, 2, 8 and 18 as eye-witnesses to the occurrence\tRatio of the decision\nThese eye-witnesses have stated that the incident had happened initially in the hall where there was some light for Accused No. 3 has brought a lamp to the hall and apart from that another lamp was also burning which was attached to the ceiling\tRatio of the decision\nBlood was found by the police on the wall of the verandah and in the courtyard\tRatio of the decision\nIt is also established from the evidence on record for it is clearly stated that the street light having tube light was giving sufficient light to the place of occurrence and that it was directed towards the house which was the place of occurrence\tRatio of the decision\nBesides, all the aforesaid eye-witnesses were inmates of the house and they would know as to who had given the blows for they specifically stated that initially the appellant did not have the knife in his hand but when the deceased and others went to the balcony then he went inside the house and brought a knife with which he gave stab injuries to the deceased which became fatal and as a result of which the deceased died while he was being taken to the hospital\tRatio of the decision\nThe aforesaid eye-witnesses, although, are related witnesses, were natural witnesses for they were the inmates of the house where the incident had taken place\tRatio of the decision\nThe said eye-witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased\tRatio of the decision\nThe discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner affecting the substratum of the prosecution case and therefore, minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye-witnesses are immaterial\tRatio of the decision\nThis Court has observed as follows in the case of Dinesh Kumar v. State of Rajasthan, (2008) 8 SCC 270 2008 Indlaw SC 2034, : \"11\tPrecedent\nIt is to be noted that PWs 7 and 13 were the injured witnesses and PW 10 was another eyewitness and was the informant\tPrecedent\nLaw is fairly well settled that even if acquittal is recorded in respect of the co-accused on the ground that there were exaggerations and embellishments, yet conviction can be recorded if the evidence is found cogent, credible and truthful in respect of another accused\tPrecedent\nThe mere fact that the witnesses were related to the deceased cannot be a ground to discard their evidence\tPrecedent\nIn law, testimony of an injured witness is given importance\tPrecedent\nWhen the eyewitnesses are stated to be interested and inimically disposed towards the accused, it has to be noted that it would not be proper to conclude that they would shield the real culprit and rope in innocent persons\tPrecedent\nThe truth or otherwise of the evidence has to be weighed pragmatically\tPrecedent\nThe court would be required to analyse the evidence of related witnesses and those witnesses who are inimically disposed towards the accused\tPrecedent\nBut if after careful analysis and scrutiny of their evidence, the version given by the witnesses appears to be clear, cogent and credible, there is no reason to discard the same\tPrecedent\nConviction can be made on the basis of such evidence\tPrecedent\nThe aforesaid eye-witnesses were cross-examined at length but even after such lengthy cross-examination these eye-witnesses account could not be shaken\tRatio of the decision\nThe postmortem report indicates that there were sixteen injuries as against the two as adduced in ocular evidence and, therefore, a submission was made by the counsel appearing for the appellant that the medical evidence adduced in the present case is not supporting the ocular evidence\tRatio of the decision\nHowever, a perusal of record clearly shows that the doctor who conducted the postmortem (PW-7) stated in his evidence that there were in total 16 injuries when external examination was done by him and the knife M. O. 11 could have caused the injuries no. 1, 2, 3 and 4\tRatio of the decision\nHe further stated that the death was caused due to hemorrhage and shock as a result of stab injury\tRatio of the decision\nHe further stated that Injury No. 1 was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tRatio of the decision\nOn being cross-examined, PW-7 categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of Injury No. 1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature\tRatio of the decision\nThere is no doubt that four injuries are indicated in the postmortem report shown to have been received by the deceased but the fact that the deceased was given stab injuries by the appellant with the help of a knife brought by him from inside the house is clearly established from the ocular evidence\tRatio of the decision\nThere is therefore one particular injury, being injury No. 1 caused because of stabbing and the rest being superficial in nature could be caused during scuffle\tRatio of the decision\nTherefore, the alleged discrepancy cannot be said to be very vital as it has been held by this Court in several decisions that ocular evidence cannot be brushed aside only because, to some extent, it is not in consonance with the medical evidence\tRatio of the decision\nReference in this regard may be made to the decision of this Court in State of U. P. v. Krishna Gopal, (1988) 4 SCC 302; 1988 Indlaw SC 76 Anwar v. State of Haryana, (1997) 9 SCC 766; 1997 Indlaw SC 2447 Ravi Kumar v. State of Punjab, (2005) 9 SCC 315 2005 Indlaw SC 170; Munivel v. State of T.N., (2006) 9 SCC 394 2006 Indlaw SC 118\tRatio of the decision\nAll the contentions raised by learned counsel appearing for the appellant were considered by us in the light of evidence on record\tRatio of the decision\nand we find that none of the aforesaid submissions has any basis\tRatio of the decision\nThere is cogent and reliable evidence on record to prove and establish that the accused has committed the act of stabbing as a result of which the deceased had died\tRatio of the decision\nBefore dwelling further into the factual matrix of the case on the basis of which the High Court convicted the appellant u/s\tRatio of the decision\n302 IPC; it would be useful to briefly recapitulate the law on the point\tRatio of the decision\nS. 299 and S. 300 IPC deals with the definition of culpable homicide and murder respectively\tStatute\nS. 299 defines culpable homicide as the act of causing death; (i) with the intention of causing death or (ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or (iii) with the knowledge that such act is likely to cause death\tStatute\nThe bare reading of the section makes it crystal clear that the first and the second clause of the section refer to intention apart from the knowledge and the third clause refers to knowledge alone and not intention\tStatute\nBoth the expression \"intent\" and \"knowledge\" postulate the existence of a positive mental attitude which is of different degrees\tStatute\nThe mental element in culpable homicide i.e. mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge\tStatute\nIf that is caused in any of the aforesaid three circumstances, the offence of culpable homicide is said to have been committed\tStatute\nS. 300 IPC, however, deals with murder although there is no clear definition of murder provided in S. 300 IPC\tStatute\nIt has been repeatedly held by this Court that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is species and that all murders are culpable homicide but not vice versa\tStatute\nS. 300 IPC further provides for the exceptions which will constitute culpable homicide not amounting to murder and punishable u/s\tStatute\nWhen and if there is intent and knowledge then the same would be a case of S. 304\tStatute\nPart\tStatute\nI and if it is only a case of knowledge and not the intention to cause murder and bodily injury, then the same would be a case of S. 304 Part II\tStatute\nThe aforesaid distinction between an act amounting to murder and an act not amounting to murder has been brought out in the numerous decisions of this Court\tStatute\nIn the case of State of A.P. v. Rayavarapu Punnayya, (1976) 4 SCC 382, 1976 Indlaw SC 192 this Court observed as follows at page 386: \"12\tPrecedent\nIn the scheme of the Penal Code, \"culpable homicides\" is genus and \"murder\" its specie\tPrecedent\nAll \"murder\" is \"culpable homicide\" but not vice-versa\tPrecedent\nSpeaking generally, \"culpable homicide\" sans \"special characteristics of murder\", is \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\tPrecedent\nFor the purpose of fixing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic offence, the Code practically recognises three degrees of culpable homicide\tPrecedent\nThe first is, what may be called, \"culpable homicide of the first degree\tPrecedent\nThis is the greatest form of culpable homicide, which is defined in S. 300 as \"murder\tPrecedent\nThe second may be termed as \"culpable homicide of the second degree\tPrecedent\nThis is punishable under the first part of S. 304\tPrecedent\nThen, there is \"culpable homicide of the third degree\tPrecedent\nThis is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is, also, the lowest among the punishments provided for the three grades\tPrecedent\nCulpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the second part of S. 304\tPrecedent\nPlacing strong reliance on the aforesaid decision, this Court in the case of Abdul Waheed Khan v. State of A.P., (2002) 7 SCC 175 2002 Indlaw SC 1777, observed as follows at page 184: \"13\tPrecedent\nCl\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 corresponds with cls\tPrecedent\n2) and (3) of S. 300\tPrecedent\nThe distinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite u/cl\tPrecedent\n2) is the knowledge possessed by the offender regarding the particular victim being in such a peculiar condition or state of health that the internal harm caused to him is likely to be fatal, notwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be sufficient to cause death of a person in normal health or condition\tPrecedent\nIt is noteworthy that the \"intention to cause death\" is not an essential requirement of cl\tPrecedent\nOnly the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim, is sufficient to bring the killing within the ambit of this clause\tPrecedent\nThis aspect of cl\tPrecedent\n2) is borne out by Illustration (b) appended to S. 300\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 does not postulate any such knowledge on the part of the offender\tPrecedent\nInstances of cases falling u/cl\tPrecedent\n2) of S. 300 can be where the assailant causes death by a fist-blow intentionally given knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged liver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is likely to cause death of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be\tPrecedent\nIf the assailant had no such knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an intention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence will not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death, was intentionally given\tPrecedent\nIn cl\tPrecedent\n3) of Section 300, instead of the words \"likely to cause death\" occurring in the corresponding cl\tPrecedent\nb) of Section 299, the words \"sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\" have been used\tPrecedent\nObviously, the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\tPrecedent\nThe distinction is fine but real and if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice\tPrecedent\nThe difference between cl\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 and cl\tPrecedent\n3) of S. 300 is one of degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury\tPrecedent\nTo put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree\tPrecedent\nThe word \"likely\" in cl\tPrecedent\nb) of S. 299 conveys the sense of probable as distinguished from a mere possibility\tPrecedent\nThe words \"bodily injury ... sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\" mean that death will be the \"most probable\" result of the injury, having regard to the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nFor cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nRajwant Singh v. State of Kerala is an apt illustration of this point\tPrecedent\nIn Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab4\tPrecedent\n1958 Indlaw SC 82 Vivian Bose, J. speaking for the Court, explained the meaning and scope of cl\tPrecedent\nIt was observed that the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under S. 300 \"thirdly\tPrecedent\nFirst, it must establish quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved\tPrecedent\nThese are purely objective investigations\tPrecedent\nThirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional or that some other kind of injury was intended\tPrecedent\nOnce these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further, and fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nThis part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender\tPrecedent\nThe ingredients of clause \"thirdly\" of S. 300 IPC were brought out by the illustrious Judge in his terse language as follows: \"12\tPrecedent\nTo put it shortly, the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under S. 300 'thirdly'; First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely objective investigations\tPrecedent\nThirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended\tPrecedent\nOnce these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further and, Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\tPrecedent\nThe learned Judge explained the third ingredient in the following words \"The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present\tPrecedent\nIf he can show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such an inference, then, of course, the intent that the section requires is not proved\tPrecedent\nBut if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to inflict it\tPrecedent\nWhether he knew of its seriousness, or intended serious consequences, is neither here nor there\tPrecedent\nThe question, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness, but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion\tPrecedent\nThese observations of Vivian Bose, J. have become locus classicus\tPrecedent\nThe test laid down by Virsa Singh case4 for the applicability of clause \"thirdly\" is now ingrained in our legal system and has become part of the rule of law\tPrecedent\nUnder clause thirdly of S. 300 IPC, culpable homicide is murder, if both the following conditions are satisfied i.e. (a) that the act which causes death is done with the intention of causing death or is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury; and (b) that the injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\tPrecedent\nIt must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury which, in the ordinary course of nature, was sufficient to cause death viz\tPrecedent\nthat the injury found to be present was the injury that was intended to be inflicted\tPrecedent\nThus, according to the rule laid down in Virsa Singh case4 even if the intention of the accused was limited to the infliction of a bodily injury sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, and did not extend to the intention of causing death, the offence would be murder\tPrecedent\nIllustration (c) appended to S. 300 clearly brings out this point\tPrecedent\nc) of S. 299 and cl\tPrecedent\n4) of S. 300 both require knowledge of the probability of the act causing death\tPrecedent\nIt is not necessary for the purpose of this case to dilate much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses\tPrecedent\nIt will be sufficient to say that cl\tPrecedent\n4) of S. 300 would be applicable where the knowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of a person or persons in general as distinguished from a particular person or persons -- being caused from his imminently dangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty\tPrecedent\nSuch knowledge on the part of the offender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act having been committed by the offender without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid\tPrecedent\nThe above are only broad guidelines and not cast-iron imperatives\tPrecedent\nIn most cases, their observance will facilitate the task of the court\tPrecedent\nBut sometimes the facts are so intertwined and the second and the third stages so telescoped into each, that it may not be convenient to give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the second and third stages\tPrecedent\nThe aforesaid principles have been consistently followed by this Court in several decisions\tPrecedent\nReference in this regard may be made to the decision of this Court in Ruli Ram v. State of Haryana, (2002) 7 SCC 691 2002 Indlaw SC 1927; Augustine Saldanha v. State of Karnataka, (2003) 10 SCC 472; 2003 Indlaw SC 674 State of U. P. v.
